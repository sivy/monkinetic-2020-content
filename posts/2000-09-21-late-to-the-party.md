title: Late to the Party

After signing up for the (hopefully) hugely sucessful "Behind The Curtain" project, I wasn't able to get ahold of a camera for either day. Although I now have a camera I could use, and could still take and post photos, they would not be from the correct days, and that's the whole ponit. So, I've decided not to participate. I hope we'll do this again sometime.
