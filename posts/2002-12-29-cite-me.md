Mark Pilgrim is [doing something cool](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/27.html#pushing_the_envelope) with his weblog posts: by searching the posts for HTML [CITE ](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/text.html#h-9.2.1)tags, he now has [a view](http://diveintomark.org/archives/citations/) of his posts sorted by who he was citing. Very useful. I don't think he needed the more-semantic-than-thou snarkiness to make his point though.
