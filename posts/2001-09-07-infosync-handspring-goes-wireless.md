title: 'InfoSync : Handspring goes wireless'

Handspring is [doing the phone/pda bit again](http://infosync.no/en/news/n/553.asp). Looks cool! I'd like to play with one. One model does away with the Graffiti area, adopting instead a [Blackberry-style](http://www.rim.com/products/handhelds.shtml) thumb keyboard.
