|Bill Brown|: [ Die Spammers!](http://www.bbrown.info/blogs/bblog/archives/die-spammers.cfm)
&gt;If you are a comment spammer (or his bot representative), I wish only the most unspeakable evil on you. You are a blight on the Internet and whatever function you serve is disgusting, ignoble, and repugnant.
