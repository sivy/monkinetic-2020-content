title: Struts 1.1 absorbs more interesting WebObjects ideas, getting better all the
  time
---
Struts 1.1 has gone beta, and has added ([among other cool stuff](http://www.theserverside.com/resources/article.jsp?l=Struts1_1)) even easier form handling and automatic pushing/pulling of values into and out of the form. This is one of WebObjects' strengths, and it's good to see it appearing in the open-source community.
