title: I'm begging you, do the right thing

[John Gruber responds](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/07/08/brain-disorders-covid19) to a [new article in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/08/warning-of-serious-brain-disorders-in-people-with-mild-covid-symptoms) that people with even mild coronavirus systems can be having serious brain disorders (for example strokes, encephalomyelitis, and psychotic episodes):

> Germany yesterday reported 298 new cases of COVID-19.

> The U.S. reported over 55,000. Just yesterday. It is raging out of control here in the United States. It’s that simple. We’ve lost any handle on it we might have had, infections are now raging out of control, and a large segment of the population has decided to pretend it isn’t happening and isn’t a big deal if you do get it.

> For those of us who’ve been taking this seriously since March, it’s soul-crushing that this is where we’re at after four months of isolation. It sucks. We who’ve done the right thing are the ones most yearning for — and let’s be honest, most deserving of — a few tastes of normalcy.

I am *begging* everyone I know - _please_ recognize that it is insane, or worse _cruel_, to pretend this isn't happening, or that it's a plot from people on the other end of a political spectrum to inconvenience you or steal your precious individual liberties... this is hundreds of thousands of friends and families suffering or dead.

> Do the right thing — stay home as much as you can, wear a mask and keep your distance when you’re out. You don’t want to get this and you don’t want your family to get it.
