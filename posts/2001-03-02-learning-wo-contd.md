Last night I had a real breakthrough in my study of WebObjects. Unfortunately, I don't have the WO 4.01 databases, so I haven't been able to do some of the exercises in the Programming WebObjects course I'm doing. Instead, I downloaded [FrontBase](http://www.frontbase.com) and installed it, created my own model, and completed the exercise.
