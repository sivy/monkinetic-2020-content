title: Tape -> MP3
---
I'm looking for solution to a particular problem. I have source audio material on cassette tape. Assuming I have a machine with audio inputs, what sort of software (preferably free, or cheap) should I be looking for to:
<li>rip the audio in realtime from the sound card to disk,<li>cut the file (it's lecture-style) into manageable portions, and
<li>convert the files  from (I assume) AIFF to MP3.<p></p></li></li></li>
