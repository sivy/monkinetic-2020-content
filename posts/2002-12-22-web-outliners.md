I composed my [R.E.M. and Jesus Christ](http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2002/12/20#item1652) post in [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/) (for which I still need to get a license - outlines of &lt; 20 lines are useless) and it reminded me once again of my love of writing in an outliner. I really would like to have a "compose-in-outline" mode in Sid one day.
