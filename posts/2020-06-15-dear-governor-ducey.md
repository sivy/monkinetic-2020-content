Sent today to the office of #arizona Governor Ducey:

> Governor Ducey,

> It is paramount that in the face of skyrocketing #COVID19 cases in Arizona, your office issue actionable guidance on mask/face covering usage to slow the community spread of the novel coronavirus. My family and I wear masks anytime we leave the house or our car, but we see almost no one doing the same right now unless the destination specifically requires it.

> There are too many citizens who take your office's "recommendations" as hand-waving suggestions, and the numbers speak for themselves.

> Please, for the sake of your citizens, speak out quickly and strongly. Mandate mask usage in public for all our safety.

> Sincerely,

> --Steve Ivy
> Gilbert, AZ
