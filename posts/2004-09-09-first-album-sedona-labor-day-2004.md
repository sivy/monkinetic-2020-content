Jodi and I went to Sedona with her parents (who were in town for the weekend) and went hiking up to Cathedral Rock. Now, the nice lady at the visitor's center told us about the 1.5 mile hike to Cathedral Rock, along the treeline next to Oak Creek... she neglected to mention the hot barren .75 mile stretch before you get to the creek, and the barren .5 mile stretch after the creek. Or the .6 mile 600' technical ascent to Cathedral Rock at the end. I think she was trying to kill us.
