[David McCusker](http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/new.htm) gave me a plug yesterday:
>  And folks need to go visit [Steve Ivy's resume](http://www.redmonk.net/resume) and consider giving him some work. He's a bright guy with enough imagination that I figure you can give him new stuff to do without worry. ([link](http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newOct02.htm#21oct02))
I usually hate to blow my own horn, but I _am_ a bright guy, I've got a lot of experience, and I've got the imagination to know how it can be used. If you need web development or Mac OS X programming work done, please [contact me](mailto:steve@redmonk.net?subject=Imagination).
