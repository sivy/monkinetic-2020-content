Ok, I'm on my second cup already because I got distracted. After noticing Scoble's [link](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/03/03.html#a2417) to Joel on Software, I decided to read Joel's most recent email article, on Building Communities with Software. It got me thinking about how the [forum](&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;discussion/) on this site works. I may make some changes around here but I'm not sure yet.
