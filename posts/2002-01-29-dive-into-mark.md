title: Dive Into Mark
---
[This weblog](http://diveintomark.weblogger.com/) is really cool. Mark is really open about his [dealing with addiction](http://diveintomark.weblogger.com/addiction), and recently about [the grief of losing someone he loved](http://diveintomark.weblogger.com/2002/01/26). Hard stuff, but heartening to read.

_In the midst of all this, today is my two-year anniversary of sobriety. Two years from today could be yours._

Thanks Mark.
