For the most part I appreciate the design decision that the #mastodon developers made to *not* show reply/boost/fave numbers on the feed lists, because it puts more focus on the content and less on gaming an algorithm for popularity or "engagement".

but I also realize that this makes it harder to know if there *are* responses! For example, [this post](https://playvicious.social/web/statuses/103719571402187136) by Jun on #playviscious actually has an interesting thread that I'm learning from, but nothing in the UI signifies that there is more content to find connected to the post.

I wonder if there could be an additional affordance in the #UI that there are replies (boosts and faves not so much)?
