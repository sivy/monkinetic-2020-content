title: Safari HTML extensions, cont'd

Dave Hyatt blogs about [the solution he chose](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005951) for the extensions Apple is making to (X)HTML to support the new features in Safari and Dashboard. I think he chose the right solution and it's fun to see the conversation played out in the public space.
