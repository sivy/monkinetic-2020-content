While looking for the previous link to the lyrics for Welcome To The Occupation, I found out that Murmurs.com started a peer-to-peer network called ["give it away"](http://remexhibit.murmurs.com/rem/themusic/giveitaway/) for trading live and unreleased R.E.M. tracks. Evidently they've run this by the band, since the band also gave them permission to include B-Sides from the various singles as well as fan-club-only releases.
