I'm not sure why it's today, but after hearing on the news lately about the recent school shooting in NY, my mind goes back to a day in December, 1988, at a small christian school in Virginia Beach, VA - Atlantic Shores Christian. On that day in December a young man killed one teacher execution-style, shot another teacher, tried to shoot a third, and broke into a mobile trailer classroom where 20-25 students were huddled at one end after seeing him coming and locking the door.
