title: 'Python+Conversant: What was I thinking?'
---
I started seriously hacking on [python](http://www.python.org) last night. As I asked on #plex: "why do we always start with the most complex project we can think of when learning a new language?"

Anyway, I started on a python library/wrapper for [Conversant](http://www.free-conversant.com)'s [xml-rpc API](http://xmlrpc.free-conversant.com). I've started this project in 3 different languages now, and I never get any farther than the last time. I suspect the problem lies in my somewhat weak OO design skills - transmogrifying a procedural API to an OO one is not an easy task.

This is no reflection on Conversant, BTW. Au contraire - Conversant's API is very OO considering the functional language it's built on. It's more the flattening nature of remote procedure APIs, and my own aforementioned weaknesses.
