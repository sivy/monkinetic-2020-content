title: Out of touch?
---
I was just reminded that the Common Log format does not include domain-name reverse lookups. I am really out-of-touch with my servers. I haven't looked at a raw server log since leaving [Germany](http://www.artlabeurope.com) in April '98, when I used to read over our Free-BSD server's Apache logs. _Sigh_
