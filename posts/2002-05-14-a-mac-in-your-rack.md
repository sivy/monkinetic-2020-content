title: A Mac in your Rack

Apple is scheduled to announce [new rackmount servers](http://www.thinksecret.com/features/wwdcrackmount.html) today. I've been around the Mac world long enough to be pretty cynical about this, but here's what I'd like to see:
<li>4-way processors: They've been talking about it long enough - let's see that <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">multiprocessor OS</a> finally take advantage of 4-way G4s</li>
<li>1Ghz+ G4s: I can dream...</li>
<li>2Gb+ memory capacity</li>
<li>Hot-swappable drives</li>
<li>Cost: ~$6k</li>
