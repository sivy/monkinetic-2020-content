title: Rails on Rules
---
Jim Roepcke has a new development blog, [Willing To Fail](http://willingtofail.com/) ("Fearless Research &amp; Development"), and he's been writing about a new project he's working on, [Rails on Rules](http://willingtofail.com/research/rules/index.html). It's an implementation of a rules engine for Ruby on Rails applications, based loosely on the [engine](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/Developing_With_D2W/Architecture/chapter_3_section_13.html) in [Direct To Web](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/Developing_With_D2W), a rules-based application framework for Apple's [WebObjects](http://www.apple.com/webobjects/).
