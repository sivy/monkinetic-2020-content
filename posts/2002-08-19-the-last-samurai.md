Just finished [The Last Samurai](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0786866683/qid=1029731190/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-6152236-9927220?s=books&amp;n=507846), by Helen Dewitt. It's a remarkable piece of fiction centered around the story of a single mother and her prodigious son who share the mother's fascination, nay, obsession with Akira Kurosawa's [Seven Samurai](http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/dvd//review/2001/05/31/samurai/) (Salon).
