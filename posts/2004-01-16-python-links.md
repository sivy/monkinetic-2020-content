Jim posted a useful link to a new [list of all the \_\_magic\_\_ variables](http://www.cardboard.nu/archives/000138.html) that are used in python modules to make them play nice with scripts, other modules, and documentation systems. Included in the page is a link to something I'd never used before, the "amazing [pydoc](http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-pydoc.html) module" which looks super useful. Much nicer than typing help(foo) in the python intepreter IMO.
