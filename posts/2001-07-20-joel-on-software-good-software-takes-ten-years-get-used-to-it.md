title: Joel on Software - Good Software Takes Ten Years. Get Used To It.
---
[Joel](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/stories/storyReader$368): "Make a ten year plan. Make sure you can survive for 10 years, because the software products that bring in a billion dollars a year all took that long. Don't get too hung up on your version 1 and don't think, for a minute, that you have any hope of reaching large markets with your first version. Good software, like wine, takes time." Excellent read if you are in the business of creating software, or want to be.
