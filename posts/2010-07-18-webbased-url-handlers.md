While walking back from the Gilt Club tonight (meet-n-greet before [FSW](http://federatedsocialweb.net/)) to the hotel, I was chatting with Brion and Zach from Status.net and starting talking about a conceptual UI bug in status.net. The bug to me is that in order to subscribe to a user's personal status.net site (say, I want to [subscribe to Evan on his private instance](http://evan.status.net/)) I need to enter my status.net identity on his site to get the ball rolling. Not that this is difficult, but it seems awkward and annoying.
