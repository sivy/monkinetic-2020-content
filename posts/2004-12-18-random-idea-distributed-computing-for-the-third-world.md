title: 'Random Idea: distributed computing for the third world'
---
A random idea I had the other day: create a distributed client system like SETI, where the processing time is being donated to third world or developing countries where processing power is hard to get. I don't know what the data sets would be, nor how it would all be setup, but it's an idea.
