We're looking into Redhat's [Interchange](http://interchange.redhat.com/cgi-bin/ic/about.html) eCommerce product. We have a possible client with a limited budget. Using an open source product like Interchange, running on Linux and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), we should be able to create a solution for them with $0 in software licenses, as opposed to $30,000 for MS CommerceServer, SQLServer, Windows 2000 Server, etc...
