title: Accessorizer -- useful ObjC Dev Tool
---
>  \[via [bbum's rants, code &amp; references](http://radio.weblogs.com/0100490/)\] A new version of [Accessorizer](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/16347) came out today. It is a very useful little app that, given a variable declaration, generates the various random Obj-C idioms that developers have to create over and over and over again when building Cocoa/ObjC apps.
