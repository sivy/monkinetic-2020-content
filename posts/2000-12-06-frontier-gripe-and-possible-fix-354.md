title: Frontier Gripe and Possible Fix
---
So I'm waiting for Userland "Frontier" to recieve a database update, through it's nifty "XML-RPC"-based update feature. Problem is, it's been months since I updated this copy of Frontier, and the update is 10500K. Yikes! Frontier's status message tells me that it's receiving the data, but doesn't tell me how far it's along in the process.
