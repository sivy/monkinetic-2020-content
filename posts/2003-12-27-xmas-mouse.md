Cool! Two of the cool toys I got for Christmas are a [Podium Pad](http://www.roadtools.com/product.html) (essential for the [PowerBook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/) owner) and a Kensington [PocketMouse Optical Pro](http://www.kensington.com/html/1211.html). This mouse is totally cool, with a retractable USB cable that hides in the mouse for easy mobility - and after my ancient MacAlly ball mouse, this mouse is amazing!
