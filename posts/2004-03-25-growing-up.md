Jim posts a [great bit](http://jim.roepcke.com/6808) about growing up. As geeks, we get really attached to our tools, the stuff we spend years in up to our virtual elbows, practicing our craft. These tools can, unfortunately, even crowd out "real" relationships - geeks are notoriously bad at prioritizing. smile
