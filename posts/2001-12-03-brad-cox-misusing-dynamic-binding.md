Brad Cox (inventor of Objective-C, the main language OS X applications are written in) is building Java Web Applications now. In [this article](http://softwaredev.earthweb.com/java/sdjojta/article/0,,12401_927161,00.html) he is complaining about the way most web application servers still treat pages as files.
