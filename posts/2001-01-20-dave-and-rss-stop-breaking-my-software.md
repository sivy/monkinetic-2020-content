title: 'Dave and RSS: Stop Breaking My Software!'
---
OK, I didn't trash Dave before. Now I'm ready to. Dave has made a big deal about [RSS 0.91](http://backend.userland.com/rss091) being his format of choice for content syndication. Now he's developing RSS 0.92 on his own, and writing tools that not only use the new elements of RSS 0.92, but his software has _stopped using the tags RSS 0.91 introduced_! How are we supposed to join Dave's "flow" if he swaps out features on us?
