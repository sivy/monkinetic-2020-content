I'm a little over the whole "[tag cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud)" (a simple weighted list, really) thing as applied to blog posts, but applying it to more socially "interesting" texts is a clever idea. Here [Chirag Mehta](http://chir.ag/) has run a series of tag clouds on 360 speeches and documents by Presidents of the United States - [US Presidential Speeches Tag Cloud](http://chir.ag/phernalia/preztags/).
