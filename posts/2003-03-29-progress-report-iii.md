Finally! It's working, and I get to have a weekend! (I don't know if I could have stopped if I hadn't fixed this thing...) But seriously, I am so glad to have this script working. I really hate that admin-type stuff you have to do to get work - writing proposals, doing project plans, timelines, etc... This is going to save me a not-insubstantial amount of time, I'm hoping.
