title: Dublin Core v. redmonk.net
---
Thanks to my handy [content management system](http://www.free-conversant.com), I've added some [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/) meta data to my templates. There's more metadata on inner pages of the site (due to the message architecture of Conversant) than on the weblog. Once I migrate to [XHTML](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/) (another goal of this site) I'll likely redo the meta-data as [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/).
