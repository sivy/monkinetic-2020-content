title: 'Recent Work: The Frankenapp'
---
In case you haven't noticed the Quick Links (or haven't cared, as is likely with a large percentage of my reading demographic) I've been working on a rewrite of one of our apps at work, and part of that rewrite is some nifty [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29)-based stuff. I think it's going to make the app quite a bit nicer to use. I've started calling this the "Frankenapp": it's a FileMaker Pro webapp where FMP's template output is post-processed by PHP, and includes several hundred lines of JavaScript, plus the code that handles the XML back-and-forth (also crossing the FMP-PHP bridge) to make it act *nice*.
