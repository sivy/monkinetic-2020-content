title: Java RSS, continued

On Jim's excellent suggestion, I spent yesterday porting [Brent Simmons](http://inessential.com)' [Obj-C RSS parser](http://ranchero.com/cocoa/rss/) class to Java. It was fairly easy, since I had the basic structure to go by. Also, I could use [JDOM](http://www.jdom.org) instead of the Carbon CFXML apis for XML parsing. (JDOM is a very Java-friendly API for XML).
