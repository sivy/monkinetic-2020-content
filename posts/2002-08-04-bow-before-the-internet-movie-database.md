title: Bow before the Internet Movie Database
---
OK, you must know by now I am a movie junkie. I love movies. Jodi, my wife, is too. We love to chill in front of a new flick, or an old favorite. I discovered the [Internet Movie Database](http://www.imdb.com) a couple years ago, but since getting our [wireless network](http://media.redmonk.net/images/modemAndRouter.jpeg) in place, we hardly watch a movie or television without the TiBook nearby, open to imdb.com. Then we follow stars, co-stars, supporting actors, and cameos from whatever we're watching to wherever we saw them last, and beyond. A movie junkie's dream, indeed!
