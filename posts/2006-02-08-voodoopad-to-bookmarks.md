~stevenf [wrote a post](http://stevenf.com/mt/2006/02/put_a_voodoopad_wiki_on_your_treo.php) about how he's using [VoodooPad](http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/) to store information on his Treo. Very neat. I've become a VoodooPad junkie as well, and -- while it's not as neat as Steven's trick -- I have a little trick I've whipped up to export a voodoopad document as a singel bookmarks page that I use as my browser's homepage.
