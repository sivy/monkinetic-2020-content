title: Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons

[David spots](http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newNov01.htm#27nov01-ketchup) a great bumper sticker:
>  "Avoid meddling in affairs of dragons  
> for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup."
Some of my readers may not know this is a clever send-up of a famous quote from J. R. R. Tolkien's classic "Fellowship Of The Ring":
>  "Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."
