title: I think I'm in eighth grade now

Oy. For kicks I just downloaded a copy of [Weird Al](http://www.weirdal.com/)'s ["I think I'm a clone now"](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weirdalyankovic/ithinkimaclonenow.html) (cheesy parody of Tiffany covering ["I think we're alone now"](http://www.heartbeatz.de/albums/tiffany/itwan.htm)), and I swear I'm back in art class in eighth grade. Freaky.
