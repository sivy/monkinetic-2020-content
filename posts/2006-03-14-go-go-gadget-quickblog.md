My friend [Bill](http://bbrown.info) has been sitting on a secret project at his work for a year or so now. I knew he was hyper-excited about it, but the little scamp wouldn't give me a clue about it. Eventually he clued me in that it had to do with blogging, and only recently he gave me some access to the system with some dire grumbling that I keep my big yap shut.
