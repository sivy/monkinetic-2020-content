title: OmniWeb 4.1 to include Mozilla JavaScript Engine
---
[According to Omni guru Ken Case](http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/archive/omninews/2001/000077.html) and Omni's road map, Mac OS X browser Omniweb 4.1 will use the [SpiderMonkey](http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/) C-based JavaScript engine - the same one used in the Mozilla browser. Cooool!
