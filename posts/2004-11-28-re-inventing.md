Hm. Dave is [re-inventing RSS's &lt;enclosure&gt; element](http://archive.scripting.com/2004/11/26#When:9:07:37AM), this time as the technology-specific &lt;torrent&gt; element. We already have Bittorrent-as-enclosure working [just fine](http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2004/11/18#041118_02), thank you.
