Jodi and I have started a blog, [Equal Measures](http://equalmeasures.org), focused on our journey of faith, justice, power, and equality. We're... going through a lot.

> Unequal weights and unequal measures are both alike an abomination to the Lord. -- [Provers 20:10, ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+20%3A10&version=ESV)
