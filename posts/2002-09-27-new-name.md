As I've gotten closer to the 1.0 release of Sid, I've been thinking about the application's name. While Sid is interesting in a vague sort of way, I've had trouble coming up with a decent icon, or brand, for the app. So over the last couple days I've been pondering a new name. Jodi and I were brainstorming last night, and one of our ideas was "Podium" - a place to get your message out. Not too shabby for a weblog tool perhaps?
