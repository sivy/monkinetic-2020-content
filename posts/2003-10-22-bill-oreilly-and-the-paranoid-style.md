title: Bill O'Reilly and the Paranoid Style
---
I don't watch Fox News, as I don't get all the fancy cable channels for my $13/mo. But I've followed from a comfortable distance the bruhaha between [Bill "Suitcase Nuke" O'Reilly](http://www.foxnews.com/oreilly/) and [Al "Snider-Than-Thou" Franken](http://www.ohthethingsiknow.com/), as well as the (evidently vivid) on-air blowup between O'Reilly and NPR's ever-collected [Terry Gross](http://freshair.npr.org/).
