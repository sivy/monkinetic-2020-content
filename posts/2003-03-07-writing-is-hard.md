title: Writing Is Hard!
---
BTW - I worked on the [corporate weblog piece](http://www.redmonk.net/monkineticExtras/software/weblogs/2003/03/05/weblogGeneration.html) for quite a while, tweaking it, taking out sections wholesale and gutting others to make it read better. Jim Roepcke and Robert Scoble were my guides, and I'm super grateful for their thoughts and time.
