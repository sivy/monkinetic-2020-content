I've found myself with a growing interest lately in a category of applications loosely known as "Social Software". O'Reilly's [Emerging Tech](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/) conference has a [track](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/22/track_ssoftware.html) on it, and I'm still trying to cobble together a definition thereof for my own use. (For further reading, Clay Shirky has a bunch of [writings](http://www.shirky.com/) on related topics too).
