By "you", of course, I mean Conversant. I spent most of the day working on the rebuild of a client's site. The orginal site (built by myself and my employer in 1997) had a Case Study section. It was all static HTML (as was the entire site) and was a pain to put together. Today I sat down and moved the content over into the Conversant site the client has been using for about a year now.
