1. **It's called [Bajooter](http://bajooter.com/)**. How cool is that name?
2. **He has fingerprints in his logo**. Fingerprints FTW!
3. **He's a young, indie web developer**, and is [writing](http://bajooter.com/blog) about how to make a small web development shop [work](http://bajooter.com/archives/method-to-rank-higher-and-get-more-traffic).
4. **He's also writing to [educate clients](http://bajooter.com/archives/how-much-does-a-10-page-website-cost)**, which is something we web developers generally suck at.
5. **He's a musician** with a [really cool band name](http://atomiceuphonic.com/).
6. **[He's educating me about SEO](http://bajooter.com/archives/method-to-rank-higher-and-get-more-traffic)**, without shoving that stupid acronym/term down my throat.
7. **Fingerprints yay**!
