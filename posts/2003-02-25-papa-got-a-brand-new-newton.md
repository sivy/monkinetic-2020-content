Yes, Clark [got hisself](http://www.romanvenable.net/index/channel/newton/2003/02/23#item277) a [brand new toy](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=3731&amp;item=3008475858&amp;rd=1). Boy am I jealous. No, I don't have a purpose for it. No, I never used the one I have (a 120) enough. No, I could not afford it, even at the low price he paid for it.
