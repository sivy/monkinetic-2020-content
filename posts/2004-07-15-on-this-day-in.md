I added a new feature to monkinetic today: "On This Day In [year]". In the right column I've now got links to past years on monkinetic when there were posts on the current day's date. I've always liked the feature on Dave's [Scripting News](http://archive.scripting.com/dir/davesWorld/onThisDayIn), and thought I'd finally implement it here. I think it adds a sense of time and history that is really cool.
