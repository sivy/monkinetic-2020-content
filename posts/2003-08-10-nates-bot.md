Nate is [building a robot](http://nullgel.com/projects/sneakers/journal_00.html) out of LEGO and custom-built electronics, and it is amazing. It's radio controlled right now and has a radio transmitting video camera. Check out this [video](http://68.10.253.75/nullgelSite/projects/sneakers/movies/Movie02.mov) of it in action (12.8 mb Quicktime). Go LEGOMAN!
