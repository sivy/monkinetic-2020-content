[Unacceptable](https://medium.com/@scaryh/unacceptable-4cdca86ba0db). Americans, please give this a read, Helen is speaking truth about us.

[Ro](https://thetwelfth.house/) had this article sitting in his "saved" list, and I've been reading it all afternoon on and off. It's by Helene Schouten, and was written in October 2015, and it's a real eye-opener. I won't quote it yet, because that would mean reducing it to "important" or "notable" parts and I haven't spent nearly enough time with it to tell which parts to safely extract without breaking it.
