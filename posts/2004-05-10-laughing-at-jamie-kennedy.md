title: Laughing at Jamie Kennedy
---
Jodi and I were over at a friend's house for dinner the other day, and he had gotten the first season of  [The Jamie Kennedy Experiment](http://www.thewb.com/Shows/Show/0,7353,%7C%7C860,00.html) on DVD, so we all sat down and watched some of it. Man, it is hysterical! Some of it was stupid and/or particularly rude, but Judge Jamie and Child Island had me on the floor rolling!! I would definitely try and catch it once in a while on TV now. Heh. Funny stuff.
