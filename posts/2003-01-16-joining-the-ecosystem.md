title: Joining the Ecosystem
---
Via my (rather pitiful) [Technorati results](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/links.html?rank=&amp;url=www.redmonk.net%2Fmonkinetic), I discovered that my recent spate of posts and my re-addition of my blogroll to the template has got me on the [Blogging Ecosystem](http://www.myelin.co.nz/ecosystem/) list. I'm at the bottom (48 outward bound links) but perhaps if I keep this up I'll move higher. -)
