If you're a Mac user, or curious about the legendary "1984" ad for the introduction of the Macintosh, [check out the history here](http://www.isd.net/cmcalone/1984.html). (That _60 second_ SuperBowl ad cost Apple $800k, almost as much as the ad itself - $900k.)

The ad almost didn't run, the board of directors hated it and almost fired Chiat/Day (the famous ad agency that was doing Apple marketing then and created the ad), and Steve Wozniak almost put up half the $800k himself just to make sure it ran. Wild.
