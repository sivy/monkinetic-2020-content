title: Truer Channels

Seth's been busy - he recently added channels (sort of like customizable &amp;uumlautber-categories in [Conversant](http://free-conversant.com)) for people he blogs about, including one for [Steve Ivy](http://www.truerwords.net/index/channel/SteveIvy) - neat! If he's mentioned you and there's a category for your name, you can also subscribe to a [vanity feed](http://www.truerwords.net/index/rss/channel/steveivy) (linked on the channel page).
