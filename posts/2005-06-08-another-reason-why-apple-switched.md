title: Another Reason Why Apple Switched?
---
Chatting with [Cam Barrett](http://www.camworld.com/), he brought up a point I had not thought of... He postulates that by switching to Intel CPUs, |Apple| could be the only computer maker to be able to offer hardware that could *dual-boot* Mac OS X / Windows. *Eeeeenteresting*. Would make my life easier as a developer.
