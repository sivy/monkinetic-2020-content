Awesome! The recent episode ("Cross Jurisdictions") of CBS' hit show [CSI](http://cbs.com/primetime/csi/main.shtml) which included the Las Vegas CSI team heading to Miami, was actually the warmup to a CSI spinoff called [CSI:Miami](http://cbs.com/primetime/fall_preview_2002/shows/csi_miami/index.shtml). Jodi and I are certifed CSI junkies, and this episode was a definite highlight in the series so far.
