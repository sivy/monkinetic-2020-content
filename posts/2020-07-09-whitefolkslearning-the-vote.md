From a thread I posted on Play Viscious, re-posted here for posterity:

* My wife and I watched part 1 of the PBS documentary "The Vote" last night and I am learning a LOT. Some notes (a thread):
* If I learned anything about women's suffrage in school was quickly forgotten, pretty much everything in there was new. I think I knew Susan B. Anthony's name and Ida B. Wells.
* I *think* this documentary started to help me see intersectionality in action some? the fight for the ability to vote included conflicts over who should be granted the franchise first: educated white women, or black men. And black women getting left out either way (it was black men).
* The fight for voting rights for women was absolutely necessary, but it hurt to see the racist attitudes and decisions coming from the white suffragettes from leadership on down.
* Frederick Douglass was a huge proponent of women's suffrage - and he and the black women's suffrage clubs were pushed out when it seemed like black involvement would set back the cause in the jim crow south.
* also: white men are bastards
