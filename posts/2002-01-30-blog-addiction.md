Around 12:30 am last night I had to call Jodi in to the office. Looking pleadingly into her eyes, I said, "Honey, I need an intervention. Get me away from the computer!"

We got our Cox connection back last night, and it spawned a bandwidth-induced site-tweaking and [blogging frenzy](http://www.redmonk.net/2002/01/29).

I always hate myself the next morning...
