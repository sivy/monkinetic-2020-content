title: Microsoft's Media Triumvirate
---
With Microsoft's release of the [Zune](http://www.zune.net/en-US/), the Mac internet is going nuts explaining why the Zune is a broken, inferior product to Apple's [iPod](http://apple.com/ipod/). And at first glance I have to agree with them. But my cynicism is tingling, and I don't think that Microsoft intended the Zune to start out as a viable iPod competitor. Instead, the Zune is part of a strategic [triumvirate](http://www.google.com/search?q=define:+triumvirate) intended to make the iPod irrelevant on Windows. This strategy is composed of Windows, the XBox, the Zune, and, playing the part of the One Ring: XBox Live Marketplace.
