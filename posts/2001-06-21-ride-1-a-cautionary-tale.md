Ok, so, having really learned nothing from my [first venture out](http://www.redmonk.net/516) on the Green Machine (affectionately monikered by it's current owner), I got the bike home last night and took it out for another jaunt. This one was a slightly longer trek - about 5 miles, all in the name of filling up the tires. The filling station down the street from me only had the for-pay ($0.50) air pumps, and I wasn't about to pay for air.
