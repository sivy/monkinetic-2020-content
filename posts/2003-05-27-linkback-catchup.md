Well I used to try and make sure I'd link to folks who were linking to me (according to Technorati), and I've totally fallen down on the job. Mostly it's because I'm lazy, but also because lately I've only been getting links from the usual suspects (Seth, Bill, Greg - hi guys!) whom I link to fairly regularly.
