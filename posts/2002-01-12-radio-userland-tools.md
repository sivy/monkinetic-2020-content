title: Radio Userland, Tools

Just thought I'd point out that [Radio Userland](http://radio.userland.com) ships soon, and along with it a new era in Frontier-based scripting for those who do not need [Frontier](http://frontier.userland.com/) as a server platform. Right now I'm developing a [Tool](http://frontier.userland.com/tools) that runs unit tests on our internal XML-RPC server. Sweet!
