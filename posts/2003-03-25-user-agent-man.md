title: User Agent Man
---
I've been following my web server logs more closely lately, and NetNewsWire now has 4 of the 5 top spots in my Browser report, losing out only to Google. My top five user agents in descending order:

1.   Googlebot/2.1
2.   NetNewsWire/1.0.1fc1
3.   NetNewsWire/1.0.3b1
4.   NetNewsWire/1.0fc1
5.   NetNewsWire Lite/1.0.2
