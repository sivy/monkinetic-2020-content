It's been a while since I've had myself a good _fiction binge_ - as an avid reader, I've often blown anywhere from 2 to 30 hours straight on a good book... right now it's Neil Stephenson's [Cryptonomicon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380973464/qid=1034668173/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-9780094-2131219?v=glance&amp;n=507846).
