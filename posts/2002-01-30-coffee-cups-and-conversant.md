title: Coffee Cups and Conversant

Dave [points](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/01/29#l432ca3452e712ebcef18ca9bbc2339ea) to my coffee cup radioFeedIcon. It was really easy to do with Conversant's [Resources](http://support.free-conversant.com/877). I just put \radioFeedIcon\ in my template or message.

Conversant offers a LOT of options when it comes to outputting your content. Any page can have it's MIME type set, and templates (cf [1](http://support.free-conversant.com/877), [2](http://support.free-conversant.com/43)) can be anything, including HTML, XML, I even tried RTF once. (No go on that one. ;-)) 

In the case of my RSS feed, the feed is a [WeblogViewPage](http://support.free-conversant.com/1861). The WeblogViewPage lets me create any number of ways to deliver my weblog content, in the past I've seen [RSS](http://www.smeed.org/1538), [Avantgo](http://jim.roepcke.com/hbwt_avantgo), and [OPML](http://jim.roepcke.com/hbwt_opml/2000/10/11) versions of Conversant weblogs using this technique.

Oh, and Dave, it's _Steve_, please. ;-)
