title: Coding for failure
---
*Whew*. Big thread on Hack The Planet - [over here](http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$6921?mode=topic), tangentially inspired by my post [here](http://www.redmonk.net/fullThread$msgNum=928) about IDL. David McCusker has a great line:

_If the interface doesn't support the ability to go on, and encourage you to code for failures, then it's just as fragile as a synchronous interface._

Have to read this thread a few times to get it all.
