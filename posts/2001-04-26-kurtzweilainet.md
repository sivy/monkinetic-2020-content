[Raymond Kurtzweil](http://www.kurzweilai.net/bios/frame.html?main=/bios/bio0005.html)'s site is a great example of using innovative technology to enhance the true communication and concept of a site. [KutzweilAI.net](http://www.kurzweilai.net/) uses flash and [The Brain](http://www.natrificial.com) to communicate concepts on Artificial Intelligence. KurzaweilAI has a really innovative glossary feature that links words in the site into a graphical, associative "brain". Worth checking out, for graphical, engineering, and philosophical interest.
