Brent from Userland wrote up a [description](http://radio.userland.com/macOsX) as to how [Radio Userland 8.0](http://radio.userland.com) is a Mac OS X app. I don't know how much Radio is going to cost when it is released, but 8.0 may be the version to bring me back to [Frontier](http://frontier.userland.com).
