I've got a couple of posts in the works but my head has gone all fuzzy. I'm going to go do some house-straightening (I've decided that I cannot use the word house-cleaning to describe any house-work I do because [the love of my life](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net) seems to always have to follow me, Doing It Right) then I'll come back and try to compose. One of the posts is the first in a series of "sites I read" posts that includes a micro-interview with Rands of [Rands in Repose](http://randsinrepose.com). Stay tuned.
