Dave [writes about](http://archive.scripting.com/2004/08/14#When:3:25:43PM "Duh!") what I've always thought was a good idea but have a serious reason to care about now: we want to be able to subscribe to audio content feeds via something like <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication/Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> and get it downloaded directly to our [iPods](http://apple.com/ipod). I'd love to be able to have |NetNewsWire| automatically add any .mp3 [enclosures](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt) to a  special playlist in [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/).
