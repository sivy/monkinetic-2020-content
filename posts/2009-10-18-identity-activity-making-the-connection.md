I logged into [Get Satisfaction](http://getsatisfaction.com) recently (using an OpenID of course), and something about this simple act got me thinking. Ive got two accounts on Get Satisfaction - one using my personal account, and one using my work account. One of the features of OpenID is that you can maintain multiple identities (one might say they tend to proliferate too easily, considering the number of providers coming online) and use them for various purposes.
