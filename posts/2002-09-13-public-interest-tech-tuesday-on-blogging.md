title: Public Interest Tech Tuesday on Blogging
---
I forgot to post this on Tuesday when I heard it, but NPR's [Public Interest](http://www.wamu.org/pi/) "Tech Tuesday" had a piece on blogging. ([Real Audio](http://www.wamu.org/ram/2002/p2020910.ram)) [Rebecca Blood](http://www.rebeccablood.net/) was the main guest, along with [David Gallagher](http://www.lightningfield.com) and Eric Olsen from [BlogCritics.org](http://www.blogcritics.org). All in all it was not a lot of new material, but it was interesting to hear the guests, and amusing to hear Kojo saying "blahg". -)
