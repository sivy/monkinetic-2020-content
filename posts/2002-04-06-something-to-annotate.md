title: Something To Annotate

Esther Dyson is quoted on [Evhead](http://www.evhead.com/archives/2002_04_01_arch.asp#75083885):
 >  "A conference is always an attempt to orchestrate. Now, it is also something to annotate."
Lately I've had this whole annotation thing stuck in the back of my head. Inspired perhaps by the W3C's [Annotea](http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/), or perhaps by the semantic-web brainwashing I've been receiving over on [\#swhack](http://blogspace.com/swhack/chatlogs/), I've been hacking on a python app (cgi for now) that will one day let you annotate this site with related links. If, of course, I ever finish it.
