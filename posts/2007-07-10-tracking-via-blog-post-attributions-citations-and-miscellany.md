title: 'Tracking &quot;via&quot;: Blog post attributions, citations, and miscellany'
---
I found myself today re-titling, converting to markdown, and tagging about 150 blog posts that came over from [this site's days on Editthispage.com](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://redmonk.editthispage.com), when each day was a post and every day was titled "Redmonk.News". While doing so I got to thinking about how I attribute links to various sources. Mostly I used the common idiom, the word "via" and the name of the blogger/source, with a link to the site or post where I found the link/idea.
