title: Fairtax is being debated in Congress
---
I was chatting with Jim last night and he told me that he had been watching CSPAN and saw them debating the FairTax on the floor of the House. I was dubious - I read about FairTax several years ago and never got the impression it would go anywhere - companies wouldn't put up with losing their legal loopholes.
