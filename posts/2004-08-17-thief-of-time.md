I've been reading Terry Pratchett's [Thief Of Time](http://www.harpercollins.com/catalog/pratchett/site/books/description.asp?isbn=0061031321), a light fantasy-sci-fi in the vein of Douglas Adams' [H2G2](http://www.douglasadams.com/creations/hhgg.html) series or Terry Brooks' [Magic Kingdom](http://www.terrybrooks.net/novels/index.html) series, and really enjoying it. If that's your bag, do check out Pratchett's Discworld books. (3.5 out of 5 whatevers).
