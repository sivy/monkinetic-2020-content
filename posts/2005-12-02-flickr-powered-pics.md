I'm playing around with [FAlbum](http://www.randombyte.net/blog/projects/falbum/), a [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) plugin that pulls recent posts from my [flickr](http://flickr.com) account. It's nicely done, though the documentation is somewhat lacking. I've added several recent pics to the top of the blog.
