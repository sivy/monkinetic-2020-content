title: RSSPuller development continues
---
Since things have been slow at work, I've continued on development of the "RSSPuller". It now reads RSS 0.91, 0.92, 0.92d2, and RDF 0.9 Simple. The code is also much better factored now, resulting in less debugging time. Thanks to the iDO Script scheduler, it's running (4 times successfully now!) every 30 minutes on my work machine.
