Jodi's iPod shuffle went *bork* the other day - we had connected it successfully to both her TiBook and my PowerBook and updated her music, but then after a few days it refused to be recognized by either machine. No lights, it didn't show up on the desktop or in iTunes, and System Profiler didn't see it on the USB bus. Wah. Just ot be sure I took some time and ran through the instructions on this [Apple Discussions post](http://discussions.info.apple.com/webx?14@285.Y9KWaiMiQvc.0@.68a67c22/15), to no avail.
