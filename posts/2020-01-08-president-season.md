I've been mostly quiet about the presidential race because... to be honest I've been quiet about everything about #politics for a while.

I do want to write a bit about the process, and the President, and I will be posting more as the race goes on, but here are a few opening thoughts:

I'm embarrassed that our nation elected Trump, and I've spent the last 3 years trying to pretend it didn't happen. That I can simply ignore the state of things is a sign of my immense #privilege as a middle-class white dude who is very gainfully employed in tech in America, and I'm looking for more ways to use that privilege to lift others.

I want to vote for a woman ([again](/search?s=hillary)), so I'm looking for ways to help out.

I will vote Biden if I absolutely must, and Bloomberg was wrong to ride the ["white, non-Bernie, non-woman wave"](https://twitter.com/steveivy/status/1213468337646100480?s=20) rather than putting his $$$ behind one of the current Democratic candidates.

Right now I like [Klobuchar](https://amyklobuchar.com/) and support [Elizabeth Warren](https://elizabethwarren.com/). I'm glad [Kamala Harris](https://kamalaharris.org/) and [Kirsten Gillibrand](https://kirstengillibrand.com) ran, but they've dropped from the race due to lack of financial support.

In general, I really like the themes that we see in Klobuchar's and Warren's campaigns: hard work and planning, two things that are the antitheses of Trump's candidacy and presidency.
