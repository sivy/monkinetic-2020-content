>  NY Times: [G.O.P. Can Challenge Voters at Ohio Polls, Court Rules](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/politics/campaign/02cnd-ohio.html?ex=1257138000&amp;en=efd4b20998a7a771&amp;ei=5090). In a day of see-sawing court rulings, a federal appeals court ruled early today that the Republican Party could place thousands of people inside polling places to challenge the eligibility of voters, a blow to Democrats who had argued that those challengers would intimidate minority voters.>  So it comes down, again, to judges who were appointed by Republicans. This is not a good start to Election Day.
