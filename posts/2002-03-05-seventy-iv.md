[Anita Rowland](http://www.anitarowland.com) linked to a [page of anagrams](http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=Anita+Rowland) of her name. It's LONG. [My list](http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=Steve+Ivy) is very short, and the only non-nonsensical result is my actual name. If I add in the seldom used (for me) 'n' in Steven, I at least get ["Seventy IV" and "Seventy VI"](http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=Steven+Ivy), which is kinda cool.
