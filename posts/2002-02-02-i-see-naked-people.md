[As The Apple Turns](http://www.appleturns.com/) comments on [reports](http://www.salon.com/mwt/wire/2001/12/07/school_computers/index.html?x) that High Schoolers in Henrico County VA were caught using their new iBooks to download porn:

"if history has shown us anything, it's that if you give a teenager any technology more advanced than a rubber band and one of those little plastic things that holds the bread bag closed, said teenager, regardless of IQ or innate technical ability, will suddenly turn into _MacGyver_ and find some way to use that technology to look at pictures of naked people."

Sad but FUNNY.
