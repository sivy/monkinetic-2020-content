Jodi and I watched [Open Range](http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/open_range/) this weekend. I had heard good things about it, and had read some good reviews (esp. one at [C.H.U.D.](http://www.chud.com) that I can't seem to find now). The movie was quite good; even Jodi, who's not typically a fan of westerns, thought so. The cinematography is amazing -- lots of sweeping views of georgeous rolling hills and skies. Open Range is not an "exciting" movie, for the most part, but as one reivew put it, it doesn't "fade" either - it seems to get more engaging as it goes.
