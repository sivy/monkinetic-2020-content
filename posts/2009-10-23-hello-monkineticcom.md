title: Hello Monkinetic.com

Some of you may have noticed links around here starting to point to a new domain: [www.monkinetic.com](http://www.monkinetic.com). Well, today I finally pushed the Big Red Button that directs all traffic from redmonk.net over to monkinetic.com. In some ways this is a bittersweet moment for me - I still feel a close personal connection to the redmonk moniker (though this site fell from first place in [the google war](http://www.google.com/search?q=redmonk) long ago). I first started using 'monkinetic' as the blog title back when I was trying to make redmonk.net into a business site (ca. 2003 I think) and the name stuck. I've grown to love it, and I'm glad to finally be giving it it's own domain!
