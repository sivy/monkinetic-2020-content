title: RDF as a model
---
I've been thinking about RDF again, this time as a means of describing relationships in software design. Business Processes, UI Screens, Participants, Database Tables - these all become resources, and the properties show the relationships between them. A Participant Uses a UI screen, a UI Screen Implements a Business Process, Participants Perform Business Processes... My analyst co-worker is drooling.
