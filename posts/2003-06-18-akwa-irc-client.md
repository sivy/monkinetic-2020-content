title: Akwa IRC client
---
Seeing as I'm hanging out in #openacs a lot these days, I wanted a better IRC client than [Snak](http://www.snak.com/). Snak's ok and all, but it's Carbon and it shows. I found a new client that seems to be very much a Cocoa app, with most of the features you expect from an IRC client: [Akwa](http://akwairc.online.fr/akwairc.html ).
