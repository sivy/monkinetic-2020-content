As described in [my last post](http://redmonk.net/archives/2006/11/29/adobes-kuler-api-exposed/), I've been working on documenting the kuler REST API. Last night I whipped up an RSS feed for any user's themes. You'll have to visit [the page](http://deliciouslymeta.com/kuler/) and login to get the link, but after that the feed will work even without logging in.
