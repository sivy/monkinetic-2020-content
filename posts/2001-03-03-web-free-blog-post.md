title: Web-Free Blog Post!

"Seth" and gang at Macrobyte have made the [Mail-To-Blog feature](http://support.free-conversant.com/2362 )
_even better_! You can now email plain-text into your Conversant site
and have it treated as HTML, rather than having to send it as HTML mail.
This was important as Outlook Express and other emailers usually don't let
you add links, and will escape the code if you type the html directly into
the email when you're in HTML mode.
