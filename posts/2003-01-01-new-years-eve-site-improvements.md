title: New Year's Eve Site Improvements
---
As previously mentioned, I've made some improvements to the site this evening. I've added a link to this ([monkinetic](&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;monkinetic)) weblog to the section navigation; I also added a couple subscribe links to the discussion navigation, too (for the [mailing list](&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;discussion/subscribing.html) and [rss](&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;discussion/recent.rss)) to make it easier for folks to find out what's going on here. Enjoy!
