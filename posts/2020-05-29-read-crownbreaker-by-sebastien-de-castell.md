title: 'Read: Crownbreaker by Sebastien de Castell'
---
Kellen and his makeshift crew have defeated (most would say survived) a large number of assassins, bounty hunters, unnatural disasters, and his own persistently scheming Jan'tep family.

Now it seems there's a... _God_ out there he's expected to deal with?

The last book in the 6-book Spellslinger series, which has been _really_ fun.
