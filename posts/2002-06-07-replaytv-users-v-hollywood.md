title: ReplayTV users v. Hollywood
---
Bravo! The Electronic Frontier Foundation is helping a group of ReplayTV users to [sue the entertainment industry](http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/Newmark_v_Turner/) (meaning the [MPAA](http://www.mpaa.org/home.htm)) in order to keep the rights that [current copyright law and legal precedent](http://www.eff.org/IP/eff_fair_use_faq.html) give them - the rights to record broadcast tv shows, to skip commercials, etc. -- the stuff you can do with every VCR in existence now. When will the industry learn? Ugh.
