[Wes Felter](http://wmf.editthispage.com/)'s [discussion group](http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss) is one of the most intellectual pieces of 'net property I visit. I only lurk, as I honestly don't always follow everything that's said there. Folks to listen to: [Aaron Swartz](http://swartzfam.com/aaron/), [David McCusker](http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/new.htm). David's mind especially is incredibly dense. And I mean that in the nicest way - his brain, as visualized on the intellectual space-time-continuum would be like a black hole. Warning: David's weblog is a journey through a mind _that does not work like yours_.
