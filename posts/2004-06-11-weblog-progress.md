Well, after a brief hiatus I spent some more time working on an import script for this site. I have a test site setup where I finally, last night, got all my archived posts imported - 1729 posts over four years, and 587 comments. The last few features to add to the import script are custom fields identifying the source of the message (Conversant) and the date of the import, so that if i ever want to display that information I can.
