title: Are you sick of Sid yet?
---
I've been working on Sid (obviously) for the last couple of days - I made some (finally) very nice improvements to the interface. In the last few versions, the settings for the conversation were done in a drawer. The drawer was almost as large as the document window, which was awkward and just not elegant.
