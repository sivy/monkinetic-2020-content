title: H.R.2382 - USPS Fairness Act
---
To our elected "representatives": The United States Post Office is one of the most powerful forces for democracy in our nation, giving rich and poor, native-born and immigrant, people from every social class and structure Equal Access under the law. There are those who, for years, have been seeking to limit the ability of the USPS to do it's job, because it benefits them to disempower and disenfranchise those who differ in face/class/privilege.

DO NOT stand with those who would destroy one of the most American of institutions.

Support and PASS **H.R.2382 - USPS Fairness Act**
