title: Bug/Issue Tracking software & OS X

If you're a small developer and have found a bug-tracking or issue-tracking system that you really like, please ping me at steve AT [this site](http://www.contentconnections.com). I'm especially interested if you're using it in a mainly Mac OS X environment.
