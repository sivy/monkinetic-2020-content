title: 'Blogs: an antidote to online bullying?'

This BBC article ([Cyber bullies haunt young online](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4805760.stm)) talks about kids in England getting threatening IMs and emails from the "Real Life" bullies at their schools. Maybe I'm off my rocker here, but it makes me wonder what would happen if, whenever this happened, the victim posted the content of the message and the identity of the bully on his/her blog?
