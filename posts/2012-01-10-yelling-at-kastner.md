title: Yelling at Kastner
---
[Erik Kastner](http://metaatem.com) and I have a sort of running gag going where I try and come up with some awful pun or cultural reference to greet him with in the morning, with a screeam of "KAAASSTNNEEEERRRRRRR" somehow worked in. Sometimes they work and sometimes they... don't.
