Seth Dillingham released a cool Conversant macro today, an [implementation](http://support.free-conversant.com/docs/dates) of the unix [strftime](http://www.neosoft.com/neosoft/man/strftime.3.html) function that is used with formatting dates. It works with several data/time related message macros, and date custom fields.
