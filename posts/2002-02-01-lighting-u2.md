title: Lighting U2
---
[Your Blue Room](http://www.yourblueroom.com) has an awesome, if somewhat technical, [article about the visual production](http://www.yourblueroom.com/media/010803_lighting_dimensions.html) of U2's Elevation tour.

Jodi and I saw the show in DC at the Metro center, and I can vividly recall each effect discussed in the article. As all good shows go, I didn't think much about the lighting during the show, but am amazed now to see what goes into it all.\[via [u2log](http://www.u2log.com/) - congrats on the [bloggie](http://www.fairvue.com/?feature=awards2002)!\]
