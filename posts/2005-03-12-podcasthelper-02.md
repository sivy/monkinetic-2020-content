I've uploaded the lastest PodCastHelper. PodCastHelper is now a Mac OS X AppleScript application, so it should be much more efficient. I've wrapped up some of the external calls so they won't throw a dialog up if they error out. Also, PCH now recognizes timecodes that start with '#', so Christiaan Stoudt's [HomeNetworkHelp.info](http://homenetworkhelp.info) podcasts work "out of the box".
