title: 'More Reading: The Visual Language of Experts in Graphic Design'
---
Though a programmer/architect  by day, I actually have a degree in Graphic Design, and had the pleasure of working with some extremely good designers in my early career. So I'm adding [The Visual Language of Experts in Graphic Design](http://lieber.www.media.mit.edu/people/lieber/Lieberary/Graphic-Design/Expert-Design/Expert-Design.html) to my reading list. Fascinating so far.
