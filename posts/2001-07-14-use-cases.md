I'm working on a project where I've been introduced for the first time to the "proper" methods of software design, and am being chained (well, ok, metaphorically) to my desk to write Use Case Scenarios. I have to tell you, there are few tasks more boring than writing Use Case Scenarios. &lt;yawn&gt;. The fact that i got up at 5:30 this a.m. and was in the office at 6:45 a.m. does not help.
