<blockquote>[via <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100490/">bbum&#39;s rants, code &amp; references</a>]  A new version of <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/16347">Accessorizer</a> came out today.  It is a very useful little app that, given a variable declaration, generates the various random Obj-C idioms that developers have to create over and over and over again when building Cocoa/ObjC apps.
