title: Querying Analogies
---
I was wondering whether Python had the concept of interfaces, like Java does, when it hit me - what I want is a search engine that will let me search using formal analogies, they way they do in the SATs back in high school. "a is to b, as c is to ?" I was really good at those, probably because I think in the abstract very well (and was destined to be a programmer -)). Anyway, I want to ask Google "Show me anything that has the same relationship to Python that Interfaces do to Java".
