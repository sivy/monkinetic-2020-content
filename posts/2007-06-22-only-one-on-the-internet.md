title: Only one on the internet
---
Quick observation: it's funny how our early years in a community shape our views. For example: In my brain, [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com) is the default "Dave" on the internet. [Wes Felter](http://wmf.editthispage.com) is the only "Wes" on the internet, and [Jim Roepcke](http://jim.roepcke.com) is the default "Jim". Any time I see any of these names in isolation online, these are the guys my brain puts up on the viewscreen.
