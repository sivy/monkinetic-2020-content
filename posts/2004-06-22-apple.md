Cool! Apple released version 2 of its [Remote Desktop](http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/) software, which is now VNC-compatible, meaning you can use it to drive any VNC-equipped computer, including those running Mac OS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, even PalmOS!

This is exactly what Apple Remote Desktop - which started life as rather an underfeatured runt - needed to start playing in the enterprise market.
