Jodi and I had a long conversation with a woman from the agency that is helping us prepare the dossier that gets sent to Ukraine for consideration. Cheri is a real sweetheart, and has a huge love for these kids. We're having to face some really tough questions regarding what kind of child we're looking to adopt and what sort of medical conditions we're willing to accept as part of that. The flux of emotions can be overwhelming -- something I had expected, but going through it is so different from imagining it.
