title: R.E.M. Unplugged on MTV2 Last Night
---
Our local stations carry MTV2 on a high UHF channel. So I was, luckily enough, able to catch a re-broadcast of MTV's recent Unplugged with R.E.M. It was, as usual, a treat - although Michael Stipe seemed bored for the first few songs. Highlights:

_Cuyahoga_: Awesome, beutiful song from Life's Rich Pageant, 1986. It's haunting live, and Michael finally began spending emotional energy while singing it.

_Country Feedback_: Slow, powerful. From Out Of Time, (1990 I think). Michael has thrown himself into this song everytime I've heard him perform it - "I... __need__ this..."

When MTV put up the Losing My Religion video on the screen behind the band, and Michael saw himself: "Who is this guy? Get him off there.... God, he's so sincere!"
