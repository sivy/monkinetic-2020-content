Been looking into [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) again... there's gotta be an app in there somewhere. A problem I see is that sometimes metadata is used to define [data](http://www.mozilla.org/rdf/back-end-architecture.html)... something it isn't equipped to do efficiently. At a later time I may try to backup my statements, but not on the few hours of sleep I'm running on now.
