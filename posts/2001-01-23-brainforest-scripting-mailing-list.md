In the absolute dirth of web resources for scripting Aportis Technologies' [BrainForest](http://www.aportis.com/products/BrainForest/benefits.html), I've started [brainforest-scripting](http://www.egroups.com/group/brainforest-scripting), a new mailing list for people interested in using AppleScript (or other OSA-compatible language) and Brainforest.
