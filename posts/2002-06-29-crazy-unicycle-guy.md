We went hiking at South Mountain last weekend, and we saw [this guy](http://media.redmonk.net/images/uniCycle.jpg) on his mountain-bike-unicycle. He rides the trails over South Mountain just like the other (seemingly thousands) of cyclists. Nuts. Just plain nuts. I can't imagine the strength or balance required for this.
