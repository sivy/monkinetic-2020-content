title: Y Chromosome is Seriously Weird
---
One thing I don't talk about much on this weblog (maybe never before) is that Jodi and I have been trying to have children for almost 4 years. We've explored various treatment options, and suspect what they call "male factor". Yes, that means what you think it means. Due to our current financial situation we're not actively exploring treatment right now.
