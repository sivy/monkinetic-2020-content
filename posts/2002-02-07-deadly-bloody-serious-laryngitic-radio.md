Wow. Garth Kidd has a [hacked-together process](http://www.deadlybloodyserious.com/throat/2002/02/07.html) worthy of [Rube Goldberg](http://www.rube-goldberg.com/html/mail%20a%20letter.htm) that lets him record his ramblings to mp3, and have them posted to his [weblog](http://www.deadlybloodyserious.com/throat/). Wow. Coooool.
