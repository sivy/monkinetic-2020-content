title: New Audio Posting Setup
---
I figured out a better solution for doing the audio blog thing. It's based somewhat on the system that Hugo Schotmann got going, and works pretty well. Dave Slusher is [using the same system](http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/audio/040927_03.writeback) now for [EGC](http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/), and notes in his [latest audio post](http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2004/09/27#040927_05) that there is some echoey stuff going on in the headphones. I had the same thing, but I think I got distracted by it, where Dave seems to have done just fine.

The trouble I'm having right now is that the drive makes too much noise when chewing through audio data, and without a proper external mic, I get all kinds of whiney noise in the recording. Grr.
