title: Convenient debug variable handling
---
While hanging in #openacs tonight I got a quick tutorial from jim (no link) on handling debug variables with an in-memory table structure. Read about it starting [here](http://openacs.org/irc/log/2003-06-13#T04-55-38). Combined with a new form of fusion... I mean, combined with a &lt;multiple&gt; tag in the adp page it makes it easy to output a table of debug data.
