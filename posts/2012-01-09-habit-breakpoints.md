One of the results I want to see from this year is to drop about 15 pounds from my "I-sit-at-a-computer-all-day" belly. I've never been a "dieter", and I've scorned traditional diet foods / drinks, especially those with the artificial sweeteners in them, and prided myself on my commitment to good old-fashioned American refined sugar. Oh, I do love my sugar (and likewise, the sugars-in-waiting, carbs).
