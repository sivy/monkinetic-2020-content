title: More on blog->iCal
---
I copied and hand-hacked one of my calendars in [iCal](http://www.apple.com/ical/) to see how it might look with blog entries as events. Blog titles get cut down to one word (in week view, my default), and there's no easy way to see the description unless you use the inpector. iCal is not the ideal blog-reader, by any stretch, but it does open up some interesting possibilities. Not sure what they are yet, but I'm hoping that by spreading the idea someone out there will have some cool ideas on great ways to use this.
