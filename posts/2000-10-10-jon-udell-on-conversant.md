title: Jon Udell on Conversant
---
[Byte](http://www.byte.com)'s Jon Udell mentions "Conversant" in his [latest column](http://www.byte.com/column/BYT20001005S0001), on the subject of web systems that tie together [http, email, and nntp](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pracintgr/). Perhaps more than Jon realizes, Conversant fulfills his vision.
