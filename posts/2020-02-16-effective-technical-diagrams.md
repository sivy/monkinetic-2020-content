Sometimes in software design it's great to develop a visual of the system in question to help in the thinking process.

Josh Barratt is a software architect at Twilio, and blogs about system design at [Serialized.Net]((https://serialized.net/). His recent post [Effective Technical Diagrams](https://serialized.net/2020/02/effective_technical_diagrams/) has some *great* guidelines for improving the technical diagrams that we use to communicate.

> Images convey ideas and structure far more effectively than text. Especially for software systems, they can even help with reasoning about things like capacity, connectivity, reliability, security and performance.

> Like any craft, methods of designing visuals that communicate effectively and efficiently can be studied and improved. We have probably all seen diagrams which led to an immediate “aha!” – and others, that after minutes of squinting, led to only more confusion.

I too, *adore* OmniGraffle, and have made my share of good and bad technical diagrams in my pursuit of a better design. Here's one I made in the last year, the usefulness of which could be argued both ways:
