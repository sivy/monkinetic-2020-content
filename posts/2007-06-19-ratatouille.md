 Jodi and I and the kiddo went to a sneak peak showing of [Ratatouille](http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/ratatouille/) Saturday night, and I cannot encourage everyone enough to go see it. It was FANTASTIC - easily the best movie I've seen in ages. The writing is excellent, the story is both conceptually simple yet complex in its depth. [Jason Kottke](http://www.kottke.org) captures a lot of my reaction to the film in his [review of Ratatouille](http://www.kottke.org/07/06/ratatouille) (my apologies for the large-scale quoting, but I want to preserve these bits):
