title: 'GoDaddy Software: Web UI Designer/Developer needed'
---
A development team here at [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com) (see standard disclaimer below) is looking for a web UI developer and I thought I'd post it here as a way to help out. This is a standards-based (X)HTML/CSS/Javascript developer position,  working with java code on a open-source stack (linux/apache/tomcat/hibernate/struts...).
