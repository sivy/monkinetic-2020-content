title: PIL 1.1.4, FreeType2 lib, OS X
---
If anyone out there has gotten the 1.1.4 version of the python imaging library working with freetype2 on Mac OS X, I'd really love to know how!! (PIL fonts - bitmaps converted from X Windows BDF descriptions - suck. FreeType2 allows use of anti-aliased TrueType fonts.)
