Daneba has Carbonized their Canvas drawing program. I'm installing it now. Macromedia's port of FreeHand sucks. IT's slow and of questionable usefulness. Adobe is MIA. So far Canvas (which I just launched) seems fast. I've heard for some time that Canvas had some really powerful features. Looks good so far.
