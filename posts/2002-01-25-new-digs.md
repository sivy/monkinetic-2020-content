Jodi talks about the new house we just signed a contract on (woo-hoo!), and laments the lack of information on the [site for our previous house](http://weblogs.userland.com/the259diaries/). Sorry folks, that's the way it happens sometimes.

Seriously - as Jodi asays, we'll try and get some pics up somewhere of the old place, and of the new place once we're moving in. It's a great place, and we got a good deal on it.
