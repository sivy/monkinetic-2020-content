Clark just showed up on my iChat buddylist, and instead of a status, there was some musical notes and the name of a Santana song! Whoa! Cool! So I harassed him about it and he pointed to a little prefpane app called [iChatStatus](http://www.versiontracker.com/php/dlpage.php?id=17192&amp;kind=1&amp;db=mac). It updates your iChat status to show the currently playing song in iTunes. Coool! Also included are aplescripts to let iChatStatus show things like the web page you're currently viewing, or the active application, and other goodies.
