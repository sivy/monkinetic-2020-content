Well, Jodi [broke the news](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/archives/2007/03/19/an-overdue-announcement). Not that it was a secret. In fact you, dear Reader, *may* be the last person to know that Jodi and I have begun another adoption. :-) This time around we're working with a large well-connected agency, [WACAP](http://wacap.org/), and we're planning on going to Russia.
