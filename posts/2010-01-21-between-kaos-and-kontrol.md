title: Between Kaos and Kontrol
---
My family is about to move into a new house, which has me pondering my management of the two parts of the house I can legitimately call mine: my office (at least during the times I've had one) and the workshop. This house will be the third house Jodi and I have owned, and it will be the first with both of these features as separate, properly delineated spaces. And I'm practically giddy about it.
