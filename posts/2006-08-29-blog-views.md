While reading [blogHelper](http://bloghelper.is-there.net/)'s post about using [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) as a CMS, I noticed the menu of views in the upper right corner. You can select "normal" (blog style), "discussions" (most commented posts), "book" (all posts arranged into a hierarchical book structure), or "best" (highest rated posts). I thought this was a very clever and interesting way to expose users to various aspects of the content.
