title: The Coming Kingdom of America  (uspol)
---
I think we're looking at the coming end of a government with co-equal branches. The Senate Republicans, tying their pursuit of personal power to Trump's own, have abdicated their Constitutional role and are effectively handing Trump a monarchy.

I suppose they cannot imagine a Democrat taking the position again, or believe in that case they will simply find a way to again redefine the Presidency on their own terms? I don't know.
