title: Speeding Up Omniweb
---
I'm not sure why, but if you're using [Omniweb](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omniweb) (site down right now) and can do without the toolbar, hiding it using the little clear button on the right side of the title bar seems to speed up the fetching end rendering of pages. Anyone out there want to venture a guess as to why?
