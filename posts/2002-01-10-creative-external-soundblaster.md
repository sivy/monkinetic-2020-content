Found on [SlashDot](http://www.slashdot.org): an external [SoundBlaster](http://www.soundblaster.com/products/extigy/) box from Creative. Looks pretty cool. It's got a bunch of inputs (including midi, optical, two minis - device and mic, and more) and as many or more outputs, including 5.1 surround. Wow. Neat.
