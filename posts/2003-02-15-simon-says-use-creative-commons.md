[Simon Extreme](http://www.lumacode.com/simon/index.html) is a Mac OS X "reinterpretation" of the classic Simon game. Interestingly, Simon Extreme is shipped under a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0), and [source code](http://www.lumacode.com/simon/developer.html) is available. As if that's not enough, the designer of the interface, Rich of [Richd.com](http://www.richd.com), is making available some [sample Photoshop files](http://www.lumacode.com/simon/SimonGraphics.dmg) of the interface, so that GUI designers can see how the interface was built up. Classy stuff.
