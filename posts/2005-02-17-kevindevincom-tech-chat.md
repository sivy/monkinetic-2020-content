I had the fortune of participating in a [Tech Chat](http://kevindevin.com/index.php?p=83) this weekend with [Kreg Stepp](http://www.spyndle.com), [David Newberger](http://www.davidnewberger.com/), and [Robert Kloosterhuis](http://www.geekswithblogs.com/jemimus/). The Tech Chat is a podcast roundtable discussion created, hosted, and usually moderated by [Kevin Devin](http://kevindevin.com). Thanks to Kevin and the guys for the opportunity to hang out!
