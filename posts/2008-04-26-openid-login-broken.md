title: OpenID login broken?
---
Apparently some readers have been having problems logging in with OpenID on the site (apparently related to [this bug](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/166832)). I think I've fixed the problem - if you've been trying to login, please give it another shot and let me know if it works.
