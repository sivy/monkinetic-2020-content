title: Web Services For Web Developers
---
Dave [writes](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/01/31#l6a79e5ea81d34b2681825105f2215b89): "We're going to make Web services work for Web developers. That means getting rid of arcane stuff that makes sense only to C programmers. "

Well, I understand where Dave is coming from, but I have to argue that without C and its practitioners of arcana, the "web" in "web services" would not exist. The xml parser in Frontier's [web services support](http://docserver.userland.com/xml/rpc) would be 100 times slower. [Google](http://www.google.com) - don't tell me that's not a web service! ;-) - would not exist.

Dave, you're not being fair to people who use those languages. I totally appreciate what you're doing in the scripting world. Seeing web services brought to the masses through your involvement in XML-RPC is a huge deal. We all talk about web services being about [inclusive](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/03/19/): don't lock out or insult those developers who choose to use .NET or whatever.

I mean, _who cares_ that there are six extra lines in that script? How many lines is a common web service? 5? 100? 1000? If a developer wants to write those 6 lines (which are probably generated for him) why can't he? Is it just because it offends your aesthetic?
