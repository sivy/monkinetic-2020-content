@monkchips @pivotal @deskbeers @BTGroup I confess to kinda being over the “opinionated software” movement, see also “convention over configuration”. These products assume that your working environment is able to accommodate the &lt;product&gt;-way of doing things.

That’s not always the case, especially in enterprises.
