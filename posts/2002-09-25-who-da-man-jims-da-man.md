I'm doin' the happy dance! Jim is one of my best friends, and after I mentioned to him that I really wanted a copy of [the Cocoa programming book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201726831/redmonknet-20) but could not afford it, Jim used his own Amazon $$$ to get me a copy - and it just arrived!! I am *so* stoked!
