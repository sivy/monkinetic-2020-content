Ok, I've got my new Java RSS parser working on the two redmonk feeds ([rss 0.91](http://www.redmonk.net/redmonk.rss), [rss 1.0](http://www.redmonk.net/redmonk.rdf)). I need to test it on some more feeds, but for now I'm going to work on integrating it into an app I'm working on. If all goes well, I'll be releasing the app (it's a web app) at some point in the future.
