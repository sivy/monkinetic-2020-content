title: RSS for MailMan?
---
I would love to be able to get some of my mailing lists via RSS. Certain lists I read a lot of, but don't want to have around cluttering my HD, since I know they're archived and searchable online. I would love to be able to read them in [NetNewsWire](http://www.ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/), following the links to interesting posts.
