I posted recently about my new job at [Re-Mac Computers](http://www.re-mac.com). It's been a good few weeks! I've enjoyed working with customers to help them find the Mac that works for them, and I've had the chance to go out and help folks at their homes and businesses to get their Macs up and working as they should. Fun stuff!
