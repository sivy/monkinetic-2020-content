title: New Weblog API?
---
Techno-Weenie has a proposal for a [Common XML-RPC API for Weblogs](http://techno-weenie.com/entry.php/view/1). While I tend to think of such things as a good idea, in this case I think the API is too specific to Blogger and Manila - the two largest blog hosting services.
