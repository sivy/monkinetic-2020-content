title: Feedster implements RSS of cached posts
---
Scott Johnson is at it again. After better grokking a suggestion I made, he [implemented a new feature](http://feedster.com/blog/archives/231_Feedster_Cache_Now_Supports_RSS_Output.html) on Feedster: getting an RSS version of a single cached blog post, by passing in the url of a permalink for that post.
