title: Need help finding digital camera
---
Jodi and I have decided to get a digital camera. Specifically, we've decided on the [Canon Powershot S30](http://www.canon.co.jp/Imaging/PSS30/PSS30-e.html). We had settled on the [Nikon Coolpix 775](http://www.nikon-image.com/eng/PDF/index775.htm), but switched to the Canon for the following reasons:
<li>3.2 Megapixel camera: the Coolpix was only 2.14</li>
<li>More ergonomic shape and weight - the 775 was just a bit TOO compact and boxy.</li>
<li>The Powershot has a microphone for capturing video AND sound; it can also be used to annotate stills I believe.</li>
<li>The menuing system on the Powershot is a marvel of tiny Information Architecture. The Nikon's menu was nearly incomprehensible.</li>
