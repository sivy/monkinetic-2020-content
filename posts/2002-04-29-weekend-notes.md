Ah.. Sunday afternoon. Nice lazy day. Jodi and I had a really full Saturday: we got up at 5 o'clock to go hiking at Squaw Peak. That about killed me, but I'm getting better. Squaw Peak is about an hour hike to the summit, but it's all going up - with no respite, it's like climbing stairs. By the time I got to the top  I had almost vomitted, and my legs were so rubbery I about fell off the mountain (the top is all crags - you have to be  mountain goat to stay put!) The view, however, is awesome - you can really get an idea of how huge the Phoenix valley is.
