I just noticed while browsing [O'Reilly](http://www.oreillynet.com)'s [P2P site](http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/conference/index.html) that all their ad links are redirected through  [DoubleClick](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/)'s servers. I have my browser set to refuse most cookies, especially DoubleClick's.
