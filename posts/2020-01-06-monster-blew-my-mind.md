R.E.M. recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of the release of 1994's _MONSTER_, an album that french-fried expectations of both critics and fans of R.E.M., after the success of the rich, string and mandolin-y flow of '92's _Automatic For The People_.

Me? I loved _AFTP_ so completely. I have multiple singles and special releases, including the one in an actual wooden box with vellum prints of the band (back when packaging was a thing). I was living in the states when _MONSTER_ was released, and I recall rushing to play it for my small group of friends, who honestly looked at me like I was insane. _Monster_ was SO different, so raw, simultaneously in your face and hiding behind a flash facade. Grinding electrics, stripped back thumping percussion, and Michael Stipe alternatively crooning or growling.

The first track, and first single, _Whats the Frequency, Kenneth?_ -- I was hooked from the first guitar, and Buck's possibly-recorded-backwards-then-played-forwards solo left me agape. My CD copy of the single is scratched now beyond believe, but treasured.

_Crush with Eyeliner_'s droning guitar wah, backed by Mike Mill's walking bass lines _#chefskiss_ **she's three miles of bad road**

*Make your money* – _King of Comedy_ introduced voice-crushing compression on Stipe's and Mills' vocals, perhaps for the first time? I was all "whuuuh whoa"

_I don't sleep I dream_, dreamy piano, atmospheric distortion, and a more tom-driven drum background that keeps the song less driven than almost rolling forward. Also featuring Stipe – Stipe's falsetto – on lead vocals.

_Star 69_ starts fast, stays fast, and still Mike Mills lays down interesting bass lines throughout. **The title makes sense** to us olds, ask your mother. *squirrelies didn't chew the wire*

"I don't know, why you're mean to me", starts _Strange Currencies_, a slow, rising tune that doesn't so much confront as much as *wish*. Stipe brings his plaintive, meaningful voice to this and I'm there for it. During a bridge, playing the strings above the bridge of his guitar, Buck adds a childish, toy-like section that is both sweet and creepy.

*Tongue* is a full falsetto crooner from Stipe, over a (likely Mills-provided) Hammond organ. Not my favorite track on the album, but I won't skip it either.

_Bang and Blame_ is a pretty full rocker, still with Bill Berry's steady but tom-heavy drums keeping the song rolling more than driving. The guitars, with a long, echoey reverb, are more accent than impact.

Nice tag at the end, too.

_I Took Your Name_ is another guitar-heavy rocker, with the wah and distortion cranked to 11. Another one that's not a fave, but I usually won't skip it. It definitely has its moments. *There was some confusion, some confusion, as to who's to blame*

_Let Me In_ – another song I will often put on repeat, _Let Me In_ is Stipe's, and the bands', tribute to Kurt Cobain. The guitar is heavy, droning, omnipresent. I believe in concert Mike Mills sometimes played Cobain's left-handed sky blue guitar for this track. Stipe's voice is almost reverent, plaintive, then powerful as he sings out his love for Cobain.

_Circus Envy_ – another WTF tune that is really fun to listen to even while SMH at the crawling, self-loathing lyrics. *Put pepper in my coffee I forgot to bark ON COMMAND*

_You_ – *I woke up in a sleeping bag, with no where else to run* I love you crazy just keep on I love you madly just keep on **I love this album just keep on**
