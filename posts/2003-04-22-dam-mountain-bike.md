This weekend [Bill](http://www.bbrown.info/blogs/bblog) and I went mountain biking over to the Cave Creek Dam ([1922](http://ww2.lafayette.edu/~jacksond/photos/9.8.gif), [present day](http://phoenix.gov/SCANPIC/cavedam.jpg)). It was an awesome ride with diverse terrain, including cross country, hard packed trails, gorges, and the large wash in front of the dam.
