title: Java/WebObjects Developer
---
Due to circumstances beyond my control, I am now available for Java/WebObjects work. I also have some experience in J2EE/Servlets, and a degree in Graphic Design. I've been developing websites in a number of environments since 1996, and have worked with clients to help them define their needs and requirements.
