Well, Jodi and I saw the new [Lord Of The Rings](http://www.lordoftherings.net) movie, The Two Towers, yesterday. It was great. Amazing, actually. There were a few discrepancies from the book, but none that I thought really detracted from the story. More action, darker, faster moving - like the book.
