A [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/steveivy/status/1292883912398499845) started me thinking about what it takes to get good at DIY, so here's my helpful list of what you too can do to get good at DIY

1. I just decided to do a project!
2. for the house I own (ie can modify)
3. and I have the physical abilities (strength, stamina, co-ordination, mobility etc.) to attempt the project
4. and I have tools
5. in the garage I have and
6. have time to use the tools
7. i could afford
8.  thanks to the job 
9. i got with my high school
10. and college education
11. where I earn enough
12. in little enough time
13. to have leisure time
14. to use the knowledge I got
15. from watching my Dad
16. and some tools i inherited from my dad
17. who had a garage
18. on the house he owned
19. thanks to the job he got
20. with his college education
21. which he parents could afford
22. thanks to the job my grandfather had
23. thanks to his skills in the military in WW2
24. and the education he got
25. thanks to the GI Bill

HT to [jmz](https://playvicious.social/@paralithode) for the reminder about physical capabilities, another privilege I forget every day.
