title: Working at Starbuck's
---
I spent the morning working at the local Starbuck's. It was not one of the [unwired shops](https://www.starbucks.com/retail/wireless.asp), but that wasn't a bad thing, as I needed some undistracted creative time. As a result, I got a good start on the design of a mailing I'm going to be doing shortly to some potential clients.
