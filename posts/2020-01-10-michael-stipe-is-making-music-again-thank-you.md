title: Michael Stipe is making music again, thank you
---
[Michael Stipe](https://michaelstipe.com/), who just celebrated his 60th birthday, is making music again, and it's *really good* music.

Hearing this makes me happy and sad. I can hear echoes in this song of some of R.E.M.'s work on _Up_ and _Reveal_, which were departures from their previous work and were generally disliked by fans (myself included at the time). Listening now I feel like this was a direction Michael wanted to go a long time, but fans weren't ready for it. I'm really glad he's getting to make his own music now.
