A late feature I added to #goldfrog that I was really happy about: hashtags! I love them on social media, and since I included a tags fields in the blog schema... so I added some code that parses hashtags when posts are saved, and adds them to the post tags. I also added a [tag search](/tags/blogging) to the site, and I have a filter that auto-links hashtags to the tag search.

So be prepared to see lots of #hashtags in my posts now :)
