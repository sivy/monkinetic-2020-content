Well, I was going to write an essay on what I'm thankful for this year, but it would be way too long and I'm headed out of town tomorrow early.  So here's the short list:  1) My awesome, loving [wife][1], Jodi.  2) God giving us the grace to survive 18 mos of unemployment to arrive here with [two][2] [jobs][3].  Thanks God.
