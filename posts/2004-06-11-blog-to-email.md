Ok, one of the features that I had on my old site was a site mailing list. You could subscribe to the mailing list and get blog posts in your inbox. I've had at least one person (you know who you are!) go on about how he would not subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://redmonk.net/feed/rss2/) and wanted the mailing list functionality.
