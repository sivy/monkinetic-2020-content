One app I'm eagerly awaiting on "Mac OS X" is [WriteUp](http://www.afstrade.com/products/WriteUp/Default.htm), from [Anderson Financial Systems](http://www.afstrade.com/). WriteUp is an excellent word processor, and has been available on just about every iteration of NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and Rhapsody; there should be a version for Mac OS X available by the end of October, as evidenced [here](http://www.afstrade.com/products/WriteUp/download.html).
