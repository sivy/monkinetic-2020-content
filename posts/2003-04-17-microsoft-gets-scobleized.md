title: Microsoft gets Scobleized
---
Well, most everyone knows by now, Scoble's headed to Redmond to become an Evangelist for the next version of Windows. I have mixed feelings about this - I've gotten a chance to chat with Robert a lot recently, and I have a feeling that's going to change (because he's going to be even busier and because he's now under the Mother-Of-All-Non-Disclosure-Agreements). So I'm a bit sad about that.
