(Updated) I now have my blogroll linked from the &lt;head&gt; of this blog (as seems to be all the rage). [Blogrolling.com](http://www.blogrolling.com/) provides an [RSS feed](http://www.blogrolling.com/br/rss.php?r=7318f359722ae64ccc8a8b984f830ced) of my blogroll, and I used Conversant's [rssBox macro](http://support.free-conversant.com/docs/simplemacros/rssbox) to generate an [OPML version](http://www.redmonk.net/blogroll.opml) of my blogroll.
