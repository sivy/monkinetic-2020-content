This is most cool: [AllConsuming.net](http://www.allconsuming.net/) is crawling the list of updated blogs (according to [weblogs.com](http://www.weblogs.com)) and sucks out links to Amazon.com books. It then shows what blogs are linking to what books - a quick and easy way to find new books and what bloggers think of them.
