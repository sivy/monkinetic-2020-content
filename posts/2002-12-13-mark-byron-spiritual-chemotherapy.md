Heh. You'll have to read most of [this page](http://markbyron.blogspot.com/) to find the reference (or cheat and go [here](http://markbyron.blogspot.com/2002_12_01_markbyron_archive.html#85637749)), but I like Mark Byron's writing and his daily Biblical and political commentary. Good food for thought.
