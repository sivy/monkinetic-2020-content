I love having a wife who works for a construction company. Every so often |Jodi| will call me and say "hey we've got &lt;cool construction materials&gt; here for free if you want them". So the other day she calls and they've got some cabinetry they're getting rid of. I went over and got a cabinet with a couple drawers and doors in it, and two shelves. After acquiring a 4x8 sheet of CDX plywood, and the judicous application of [Liquid Nails](http://www.liquidnails.com/) and threaded fasteners, I managed to construct a very servicable workbench, replacing the lower half of an old credenza I'd been using.
