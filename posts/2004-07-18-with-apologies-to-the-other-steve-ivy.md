title: With Apologies to the Other Steve Ivy
---
Ok, so I've been doing some thinking about this whole [other Steve Ivy thing](http://redmonk.net/archives/2004/07/15/the-other-steve-ivy). While [0wnz0ring the top spot on Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=Steve+Ivy&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8) may be fun for bloggers who enjoy messing with PageRank, it's not really fair for someone like [Steve Ivy](http://apps.heritagecoin.com/wordfromsteve.php), lead coin expert at [Heritage Gelleries](http://www.heritagegalleries.com/common/about.php?target=ivy).
