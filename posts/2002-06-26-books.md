I went to the public library to day and came back with an armload of books. The Phoenix Library system rocks. My titles:

*   The Cathedral and the Bazaar (for fun)
*   Server-based Java Programming (to get a better understanding of how Java handles networking etc)
*   Enterprise JavaBeans (expanding my horizons some)
*   The Humane Interface (HCI design, by Jeff Raskin, Mac interface designer)
*   Mapping Web Sites (information architecture brushup)
