title: TinWhistle (was NewBase60)
---
Apropos of my recent interview with [Tantek Çelik](http://tantek.com) about URL shorteners, I've ported his [NewBase60](http://tantek.pbworks.com/NewBase60) code (part of his [CASSIS project](http://tantek.pbworks.com/CassisProject)) to perl. It's now found on github at 

<http: github.com="" sivy="" tinwhistle="">. This code converts numbers (in this case, dates expressed as days-since-the-epoch) into a base60 (sexagesimal) representation that's *really* short. For example, '1971-06-29' becomes '94', and '2010-05-26' becomes '45v'.</http:>
