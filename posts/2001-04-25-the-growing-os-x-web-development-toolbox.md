title: The growing OS X web development toolbox
---
I'm slowly working towards a complete toolkit under OS X. [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/bbedit_for_X.html) has come to OSX, and [CVL](http://209.198.73.140/Apps/WebObjects/Softrak.woa/4/wa/displayPackage?package=1035&amp;os=20) is working pretty well, and I'm looking forward to getting [Dreamweaver](http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/) and [Fireworks](http://www.macromedia.com/software/fireworks/) on OSX. [Freehand for OS X](http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/proom/pr/2001/index_fh10_ships.fhtml) is on it's way (May).
