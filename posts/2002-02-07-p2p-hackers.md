I had dinner recently with [Wes Felter](http://wmf.editthispage.com) while he was in Phoenix, and we got to talking about peer-to-peer technologies. It's been rattling around in my head ever since. Yesterday I was emailing with Wes and he suggested getting on #p2p-hackers on irc.openprojects.net. 

I finally found an irc client for Mac OS X ([Snak](http://www.snak.com)) and got on. While there I ran into [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com), who in turn pointed me to the work he's doing in distributed information spaces (based on RDF-style tuples) in the [Plex](http://www.plexdev.org). Mmmmm, distributed RDF.
