title: Turck MMCache failing on Mac OS X 10.3.7 (client)
---
I'm trying to get the php accelerator [MMCache](http://turck-mmcache.sourceforge.net/index_old.html) running on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.3.7, and it's failing. I've followed the [install instructions on Jacken's weblog](http://jacken.dyndns.org/blog/archives/2004/07/13/installing-turck-mmcache-php-accelerator/), and tried the [install process described in this Appletalk Australia article](http://www.appletalk.com.au/articles/index.php?article=3903).
