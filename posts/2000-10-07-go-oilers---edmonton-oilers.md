<a href="http://www.oilogger.com/">Oillogger.com</a>: Edmonton Oilers weblog launches with first game of season

A new weblog for the Edmonton Oilers launched this evening with not even an hour to go before the first game of the season.

Now, I don&#39;t give a lick about hockey, but &quot;Jim&quot; is the Man, so check out his <a href="http://www.oilogger.com/">most-cool site</a> for his hometown favs.
