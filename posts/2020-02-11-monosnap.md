Now that I'm blogging more often, I often find myself uploading screenshots. MacOS' capabilities are fine, except that I don't really like uploading files with names like "Screen Shot 2020-02-10 at 10.38.34 PM".

Yesterday [I asked](https://twitter.com/steveivy/status/1227107371660369922?s=20):

> Are there any #macos screenshot utilities that will simply let me name the file before saving it? (My needs are simple, the OS’ own utility is quite sufficient except for the name thing)

My old Six Apart mate [Simon Wistow mentioned](https://twitter.com/deflatermouse/status/1227123219397668864) [Monosnap](https://monosnap.com/welcome) a free utility that does exactly that - lets me name the file before saving it.

(Conveniently, it also make recording gif screen captures stupid easy)
