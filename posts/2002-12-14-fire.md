(from [MacNetJournal](http://www.whiterabbits.com/MacNetJournal/archives.html#note_328)) The open-source chat client [Fire](http://fire.sourceforge.net/) has been updated to support more AIM features (fire transfers, .mac support, direct chat connections, etc). If iChat is too cutesy for you, check it out.
