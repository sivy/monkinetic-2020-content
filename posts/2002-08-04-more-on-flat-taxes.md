title: More on Flat Taxes
---
Jim tells me he's been talking about flat taxes for years on HBWT, and pointed me to [fairtax.org](http://fairtax.org/). BTW - the "Fair Tax" they support is not an income tax, but a sales tax ([overview here](http://www.fairtaxvolunteer.org/smart/sketch.html)). Meaning it's very transparent  - you know what you're paying and when. An interesting approach.
