Brent is [thinking about](http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2032) creating a mailing list for Mac OS X application developers who are working in the area of webservices, specifically desktop apps for web services. I think this is a great idea, and will help show others what a great platform Mac OS X is!
