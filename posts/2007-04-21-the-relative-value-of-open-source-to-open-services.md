title: The Relative Value of Open Source to Open Services

[Chris Messina](http://factoryjoe.com/blog) posted an exploration of the whole [open source v. open services conversation](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/04/15/the-relative-value-of-open-source-to-open-services/). I'm going to respond here in the near future, but wanted to point to it while it's fresh in my mind.
