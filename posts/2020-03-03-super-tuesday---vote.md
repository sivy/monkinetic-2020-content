#supertuesday Get out and #vote!

The powers that be want us apathetic, or alternatively too cognitively and emotionally overwhelmed to get engaged. I'm struggling with this myself, and with Arizona was voting today.

Personally I support Elizabeth Warren. She's smart, tough, and terrifies #oldwhitemen. All of which I can get behind.
