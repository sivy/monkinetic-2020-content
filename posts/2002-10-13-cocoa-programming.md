A new Cocoa book, [Cocoa Programming](http://www.cocoaprogramming.net/), is shipping. Not sure _what_ the deal is with the anemone on the cover though. Authors [Scott Anguish](http://www.cocoaprogramming.net/AuthorBios.html#scott), [Erik Buck](http://www.cocoaprogramming.net/AuthorBios.html#Erik), and [Don Yacktman](http://www.cocoaprogramming.net/AuthorBios.html#Don) are serious long-time Cocoa hackers, and the [aspiring Cocoa jedi](http://www.redmonk.net) would be foolish to ignore their tome.
