Inspired to go looking after Dave linked to the perl.org [RSS feeds of their job listings](http://jobs.perl.org/rss/), I just found that [jobmart.com](http://www.jobmart.com) has feeds of each of their job databases:

*   Mac OS X: http://macosx.jobmart.com/Resumes/JobOpennings/RssFeed
*   Linux: http://linux.jobmart.com/Resumes/JobOpennings/RssFeed
*   Python, Plone, Zope: http://python.jobmart.com/Resumes/JobOpennings/RssFeed
*   Wireless: http://wireless.jobmart.com/Resumes/JobOpennings/RssFeed
