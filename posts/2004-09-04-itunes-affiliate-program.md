Ok, so I signed up for the [iTunes Music Store affilliate program](http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/) to see what all the hoopla is about. So far I'm not impressed - the only options for links that are available are an iTunes logo that links to the <abbr title="iTunes Music Store">iTMS</abbr>. I'm hoping that they will add a way to link to specific products, like you can with Amazon's affiliate program. This would make so much more sense in the context of a weblog site, what with all the "what I'm listening to" links out there.
