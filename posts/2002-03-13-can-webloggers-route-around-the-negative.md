>  1:38 PM: The weblogger community will route around hate speech and bigotry online.
I wonder if that's true. We've seen the Google effect when webloggers start linking to something. Someone spouts some bile - can the weblog community resist linking it? That's my idea of routing around it. If we link it, it is soon rising in  Google's ranks, the internet equivalent of a PR victory. So yes, maybe we can route around it, but I'm not certain.
