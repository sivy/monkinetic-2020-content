Hehe. I went looking for information again this year on planting a winter lawn (something we have to do in Arizona since the Bermuda that survuves the summer heat can't survive the cooler winter temps) and discovered that [my weblog post](http://www.redmonk.net/1540) from last year is the #2 result on Google for [arizona winter lawn](http://www.google.com/search?q=arizona+winter+lawn+&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8). Not that it helps, but it was funny.
