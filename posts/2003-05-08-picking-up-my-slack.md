title: Picking Up My Slack
---
Jodi, dear that she is, has been picking up my blogging slack lately over on . She's covered our visit to Paulo Soleri's [Arcosanti](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index/2003/05/06#item172), my mom's plans for an [Ivy Family portal](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index/2003/05/06#item171), as well as a site of her own, and she's [reviewed X-Men 2](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index/2003/05/07#item174), which we saw yesterday (hint- it rocked!). If posting seems slack here,  for the latest!
