Thanks to two loal Libraries, I am now in possession of three of [Edward](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0961392142/qid=1044315251/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-3104707-5991217?v=glance&amp;s=books) [Tufte](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0961392118/qid=1044315251/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-3104707-5991217?v=glance&amp;s=books)'s [masterful](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0961392126/qid=1044315251/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/002-3104707-5991217?v=glance&amp;s=books) tomes.

So far I'm most interested in <u>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</u>, the earliest of the three (1983).
