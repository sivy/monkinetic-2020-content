Doing some work this evening... I lost my [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) subscriptions and managed to rebuild most of them from the cache folder, so I spent the time cleaning out the list, unsubscribing from many feeds that I just did not care about anymore. In the same spirit, I've been unsubscribing from a ton of mailing lists, and re-subscribing to them from my [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com/gmail) account. Let Google store my list archives, with all its searchable gigabyteness.
