Jodi and I took a real-life vacation this weekend! We drove out to Yucaipa, California, about 6 hours west of Phoenix. We saw the salton Sea (HOT and humid and boring), windmill farms around Palm Springs, got to go sailing with friends on the Pacific (launching from Long Beach) and go hiking in the mountains of San Bernardino National Forest.
