Book 2 of the _Tao_ books by Wesley Chu. This series has gotten some guff due to _The Lives of Tao_ being written as a National Novel Writing Month project, and perhaps I was more invested having read the _Io_ books first, but dammit I really like these books.

Also, knowing that there was a third book in the queue, the ending of this one was a big _WHAAaaa?_ (but it was worth it in book 3)
