The "column-view" in Mac OS X, affectionately known to Cocoa geeks as an NSBrowser, is a really really awesome and efficient way of browsing hierarchies. I'm working on an app (on and off) that needs an NSBrowser, so I'm posting this link to the [Using Browsers](http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Cocoa/TasksAndConcepts/ProgrammingTopics/Browser/index.html) topic of the Cocoa Programming Topics documentation.
