I really want to use my domain. I own 

<http: www.redmonk.net=""></http:>

, but I don't have a place to host it that either 1) has "Manila", or 2) is under my control so that I can do what I damn well please with it. Until I can find a hosting solution that meets those requirements, Redmonk stays here.

<http: www.redmonk.net=""></http:>

 is currently hosted wiith [Llamacom.com](http://www.llamacom.com), a small hosting setup somewhere in Iowa I think. It's cheap, and I can ftp stuff there. But since I started using "Manila", I've been spoiled. So all my effort goes here, instead of there.

Being a good web developer without my own server, is so... embarassing. *sigh*.

I think if I ever wrote a CMS, the combination of "Frontier"/"Manila" would be my inspiration and model. I hope "Dave" would see that as a compliment. ";-&gt;"

BTW, "Dave" is a [prolific writer](http://www.scripting.com). And I've never been hooked on a website like I'm hooked on "Scripting News". Thanks, Dave.
