title: Learning CSS Writeup
---
Hopefully next week I'll write up a quick summmary of my experiences with CSS so far. Much thanks to [James Spahr](http://www.designweenie.com/blog) and [Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org) for their help and advice. James even took my monkey-wrenched stylesheet and untwisted it for me - including comments! Woohoo!
