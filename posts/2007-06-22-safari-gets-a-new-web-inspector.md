title: Safari gets a new Web Inspector!
---
Yesterday on the [Surfin' Safari blog](http://webkit.org/blog), it was announced that the webkit nightlies have a [new web inspector](http://webkit.org/blog/108/yet-another-one-more-thing-a-new-web-inspector/). This new inspector is vastly improved over the [previous web inspector](http://webkit.org/blog/41/introducing-the-web-inspector/) and is actually approaching Firefox's [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com) extension in usefulness.
