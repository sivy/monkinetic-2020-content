Jodi and I are watching [Calendar Girls](http://video.movies.go.com/calendargirls/), a cute and touching movie about a group of older women in England who decide to pose "semi-clothed" for a charity calendar. It's cute, but it's also deeper than I expected. Unlike [The Full Monty](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119164/), which ended on the triumphant note, Calendar Girls follows the women as they deal with the ramifications of their success. Rent it sometime, it's pretty good!
