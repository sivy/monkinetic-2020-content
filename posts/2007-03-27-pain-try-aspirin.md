Jodi and Adelina and I went to her company's family picnic on Saturday, and much fun was had. Of most interest was Jodi's participation in the company horseshoe tournament - she and her partner won their first two games but finally lost as they started to get tired. Pitching big metal horseshoes 30 feet at a time is not as easy as it looks! Ask Jodi and I, who are both nursing sore shoulders and hips! (I did not play in the tournament but I pitched my share of shoes between rounds...) I don't envy Jodi, who as the family Queen Flinger pitched way more horseshoes than I did!
