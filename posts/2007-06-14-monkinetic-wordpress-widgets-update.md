title: Monkinetic Wordpress widgets update
---
I can't remember if I posted about this when I put up the "On This Day In..." widget, but I finally got my widgets (both [On This Day In...](http://redmonk.net/projects/widget_onthisday/) and the [hCard About Box](http://redmonk.net/projects/widget_hcard_about/)) into the public [monkinetic widgets repository](http://www.redmonk.net/svn/monkinetic_widgets/). Browse the repository [here](http://redmonk.net/websvn/listing.php?repname=monkinetic_widgets&amp;path=%2F&amp;sc=0).
