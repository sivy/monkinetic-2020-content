Aquaminds has just released [NoteTaker 2003](http://www.aquaminds.com/product.jsp), a most cool outliner and organizer. NoteTaker lets you define sections and pages (outlines) in your notebook document, maintains a table of contents (also an outline) and lets you drag most any kind of file into it. It also help you maintain quite a list of metadata, and record audio bits too (which you can then drag out of the outline as mp3 files). This is really cool, and I'm going to explore some more.
