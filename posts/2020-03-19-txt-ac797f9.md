#COVID #privilege

I'm trying to keep my social media exposure down because it's just adding to my stress, but this is my regular reminder that I am extraordinarily privileged to be currently riding things out while working from home.

Things will get worse, but right now there are SO MANY folks already suffering and I realize that.
