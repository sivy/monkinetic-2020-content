Adoption Document Specialists (or Cheri as we know her :-) ) got a new (if temporary) website up! And they have a link to |Jodi|'s weblog at the bottom of their [references page](http://www.wedodocs.org/pages/4/index.htm)! Cool! We would heartily recommend Cheri and ADS to anyone considering adopting from Ukraine.
