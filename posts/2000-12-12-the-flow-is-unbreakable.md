title: The Flow is Unbreakable
---
[The soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000051Y2K/o/qid=976570029/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_pm_1_3/104-1047641-4051956) from the movie [Unbreakable](http://www.redmonk.net/2000/12/06) is the sound of my life at this particular moment. It is filled with swelling, soaring Tim-Burton-esque strings fractured by nearly inaudible piano wanderings. String along again into thundering trip-hoppy walk-along beats. Flow.
