title: A Day Without &quot;Get&quot;

Perusing "Seth"'s older posts, I stumbled on [this one](http://truerwords.free-conversant.com/2000/11/08#TW389), on the overuse/misuse of the word "get" in American English vernacular. Hmmm. Conciously changing one's speaking patterns must be (notice I did NOT write "has got to be") one of the most difficult exercises I know. I've tried it a couple times before.
