title: 'Mo Martin: On Jews, Looting, and Whiteness'
---
[Mordecai Martin](https://mordecaimartin.net), a thinker and writer who I follow on [Play Vicious](https://playvicious.social), posted [this powerful piece](https://mordecaimartin.net/2020/06/11/on-jews-looting-and-whiteness/) on the Jewish response to racial protests and - yes looting - during the 60s and now with the George Floyd protests.

I'm not sure that – being neither Jewish nor black – I have a platform for comment, but Mo's writing speaks to his own Jewish people with real power and love.

As [Artist Marcia X](https://www.artistmarciax.com/) on Play Vicious responded:

> imagine being this tender and powerful at the same time???
