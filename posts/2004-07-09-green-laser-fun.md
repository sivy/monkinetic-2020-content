Gadget Madness [reviews the Green Laser Pointer](http://www.gadgetmadness.com/archives/20040706-review_green_laser_pointer_ii_from_thinkgeek.php) from [ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com/):
&gt;5 out of 5 Predators agree that the green laser pointer is bad because they are usually attached to a semi-automatic weapon of some sort, which means the spillage of glowing green Predator blood. If you see a Predator, for pete's sake don't be stupid and whip out your green laser pointer and shine it at him. This really pisses them off, so don't say we didn't warn you.
