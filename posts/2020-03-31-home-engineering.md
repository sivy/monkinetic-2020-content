I'm no tailor, but I spent last night learning how to measure, cut, and yes, sew #diy face masks. We're working from [this series of videos](https://www.fabricpatch.net/face-masks-for-covid-19-relief.htm) on The Fabric Patch, a quilting site.

We acquired cotton fabric and some featherweight non-woven fabric (Pellon) from Joanne's before the stay-at-home order came out in Arizona yesterday, so we're working with that. I'm able to sew a straight stitch well enough, but struggling some with getting the fits right on family members, and we're still experimenting with nosepieces (pipe cleaners are too soft, some 20g electrical wire might work)

I have always had huge respect for those who were wise in the ways of fabric, even more so now.
