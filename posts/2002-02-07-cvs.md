I've spent most of the morning checking in changes to my application here at work. I've found a pretty good process that helps me makes sure that the comments that go into CVS represent what has changed in the code.

*   Use CVL to identify changed files.
*   Open the file in [FileMerge](http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?FileMerge) to see the differences between versions.
*   I have an [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/) document for tracking change notes.
*   I go through the diff in FileMerge, and put my comments in the outline under the filename.
*   When done, I paste the comments from OmniOutliner into the comments field when checking in the code.
