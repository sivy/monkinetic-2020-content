Via old friend [Jim Roepcke](https://jim.roepcke.com/blog/archives/2006/09/01/how-hitler-became-a-dictator.html), from 2006:

Jacob G. Hornberger: [How Hitler Became a Dictator](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2006/09/jacob-hornberger/how-hitler-became-a-dictator/):

> But how many people know how Hitler actually became a dictator? My bet is, very few. I’d also bet that more than a few people would be surprised at how he pulled it off, especially given that after World War I Germany had become a democratic republic.

> Although the National Socialists never captured more than 37 percent of the national vote, and even though they still held a minority of cabinet posts and fewer than 50 percent of the seats in the Reichstag, Hitler and the Nazis set out to consolidate their power. With Hitler as chancellor, that proved to be a fairly easy task. 

I read this back when Jim first posted it in 2006, and a couple of times since, and it's even more apropos today.
