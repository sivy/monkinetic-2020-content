Jodi [posted last night](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index/2003/03/20#item148) about an Iranian woman we got to spend last evening with. She and her family survived the ten year war with Iraq, and had to flee their homes on the Iran/Iraq border when Saddam's troops came. It was fascinating to hear.
