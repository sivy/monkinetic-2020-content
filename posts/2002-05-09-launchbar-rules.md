title: Launchbar Rules

If you use Mac OS X, you simply _must_ get [Launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/), from [Objective Devlopment](http://www.obdev.at/). I'll not rant more now, just get over to Objective Development and get it. $19.95, and the best shareware you'll buy. Do it simple, do it right.
