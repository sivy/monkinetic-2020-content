title: Scoble on HTTP Business Services

Hmm. [Robert Scoble is touting HTTP Business Services](http://scobleizer.ManilaSites.Com/discuss/msgReader$311). "His company is being kept afloat by building HTTP Business Services inside corporate firewalls. Makes sense, actually. Businesses have the money to spend on improving their processes and information systems."
