title: D.TRANCE - as bright as it is loud
---
Heh. I acquired a 2.2 hour recording today from one of my favorite German trance techno DJ's, Gary D. It's a mind-blowing trip -- listening takes me back to a 6+ hour show he put on in a small club in northern Germany back in '96 or so that was as fun as it was exhausting. If you like hard trance (which I do) his stuff is sublime. Curious as to whether he ever made it out of Europe, I Google'd him and found his website, [D.TRANCE](http://www.dtrance.com/index2.html). Whew! It's as bright as the music is loud!
