title: Human-Readable Time Presentation
---
Inspired by |Dunstan Orchard|'s entry on [how he's presenting times in his blog posts](http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/07/23/redesign-time-presentation), I've added a similar feature to monkinetic, helped along by the lovely |WordPress| [plugin](http://www.ifelse.co.uk/archives/2004/07/24/time-of-day/) that [phu](http://www.ifelse.co.uk/) developed.
