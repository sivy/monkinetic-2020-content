<div class="subhead">Hello</div>

My name is Steve Ivy, and I run [redmonk.net](http://www.redmonk.net). I'm a web developer by trade, formerly of U-Haul, Compass Technology Management, CBN, and ArtLab Europe. My unofficial title could be web architect, designer, and Conversant/XML/R.E.M. evangelist.
