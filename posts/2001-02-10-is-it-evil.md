title: Is it evil?
---
From the [I Still Don't Get It Department](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/02/09). Why does a leader of the commercial software community write [software](http://frontier.userland.com), the source for whose internals is largely available? What if I modify his software to suit my own purposes and break it? Following the logic of commercial software, wouldn't the software be better if it was in a black box? Is his software non-proprietary? Open source? Evil? Questions questions questions. I have so many questions.
