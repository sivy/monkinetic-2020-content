Since we're working on [another adoption](http://redmonk.net/archives/2007/03/20/on-the-road-again/) that will involve some very expensive travel, we had decided to start looking into deals that would help us rack up some mileage. So, Jodi found out that Dish offers some sort of mileage deal when you sign up. Cool, huh? Well, yes and no.
