Yesterday the news came out that [Chris Messina](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/), my [DiSo](http://diso-project.org) co-conspirator, and [Will Norris](http://willnorris.com), author of the WP-OpenID plugin, are joining [Vidoop](http://vidoop.com) to work on DiSo full time. This is *excellent* news, for Chris and Will obviously, but also for the ideas and ideals that DiSo represents.
