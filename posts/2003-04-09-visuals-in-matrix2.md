---
Wired has a [totally cool article](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html) on the special effects in the new [Matrix films](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com), and how Gaeta and crew are stretching the limits of how realistic CG is done. Awesome! I cannot wait for this movie. May 15!!!!
