title: Ah, the terror of Technorati
---
I should never pay attention to the weblog popularity contests/ link-tracking sites like [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/), because I'm not a popular blogger and will likely never be. I'm interested in too many things, and get distracted too easily. I'm rarely effectively witty, and too clever for my own good. I don't write too badly, but I'll never win an award for it, and the only time I'm gaspingly passionate is when I'm about to stick my foot in my mouth.
