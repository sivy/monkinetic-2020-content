title: 'Help wanted: OS X wireless enabled on startup?'
---
At work we're trying to set up a bunch of users on laptops with directory-based authentication and home directories. The trouble we're running into is that these laptops are all wireless, and on OS X, airport doesn't start until a user logs in. Therefore the machine can't see the authentication directory on the network until a local user has logged in and out again.
