James Duncan Davidson (Author of [tomcat](http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html) and [ant](http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html)) on Enterprise Java Beans: >  \[via [James Duncan Davidson ](http://www.x180.net/Blog)\]Mike Clark was [just muttering about EJBs](http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2002/10/17#Software/J2EE/WagYourEJB) and how they can lead you over the brink of complexity. And he asks: "Where did we go wrong?" ([link](http://www.x180.net/Blog/2002/10/17#Computers/Java/EJBGoPop))
