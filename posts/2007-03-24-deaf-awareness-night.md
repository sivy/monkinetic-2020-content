title: '&quot;Deaf Awareness Night&quot;'
---
Last night, we had a bit of fun at the Ivy house. Jodi and I are taking a sign class, and we've been trying to find time to practice, as well as give Adelina time to practice her sign as well. So last night after dinner, I announced that I was "deaf" for the night and that Adelina and Jodi would have to sign to me and vice versa.
