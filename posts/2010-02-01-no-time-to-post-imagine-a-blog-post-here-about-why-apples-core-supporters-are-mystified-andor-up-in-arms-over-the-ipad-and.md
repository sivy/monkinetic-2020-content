No time to post. Imagine a blog post here about why Apple's core supporters are mystified and/or up in arms over the iPad, and a clever Venn diagram showing the overlap of professional designers, web designers, and unix-lovers; and a non-connected circle labeled "everyone else". Then imagine a circle labeled iPad that completely surrounds "everyone else" and barely grazes the others. Discuss.
