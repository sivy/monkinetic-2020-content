Been checking out [Amphetadesk](http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/) again lately. Amphetadesk is a desktop RSS reader, currently in alpha for version 0.93. Its creator, [Morbus](http://www.disobey.com) (aka [Kevin](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/779)), has been doing a great job - Amphetadesk has a new architecture that makes for easy hackability, a virtue for any perl-based software, which Amphetadesk is.
