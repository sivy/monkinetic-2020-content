|Jodi| and I went to see Spielberg's new movie, [War of the Worlds](http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/waroftheworlds/) last night. I wasn't sure what to expect, and had tried to stay away from spoiler sites (which are generally a guilty pleasure of mine). I read the original novel by H. G. Wells in an anthology I got as a kid, and also had heard the [Orson Welles 'Mercury Theater on the Air' broadcast](http://www.rense.com/general4/hg.htm) on cassette tape as a teen. Speilberg's vision borrows from both, and exudes the hopelessness and desperation that Orson Welles' interpretation captured so brilliantly.
