Wow, Adelina started pre-school yesterday. She had a good day yesterday - a bit teary when she realized that mommy wasn't staying, but then she had a great time! Today... man, she did NOT want to get out of bed!! :-) After we got her calmed down and reminded her about her new friends, she perked up and was out the door with few problems. Jodi dropped her off at school and she linked arms with her classmates and off she went!
