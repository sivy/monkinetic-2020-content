title: Mad and Educated, Primitive and Wild

Hm. The first song in my "R.E.M. Revealed" playlist (random songs from my extensive R.E.M. collection) this morning: ["Welcome to the Occupation"](http://www.remrock.com/remrock/lyrics/albums/document.html?song=welcome).
>  Hang your collar up inside   
> Hang your dollar on me   
> Listen to the water still   
> Listen to the causeway   
> You are mad and educated   
> Primitive and wild   
> Welcome to the occupation
