title: Tab-less Safari Tabs

[JY](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001103/) posts an [interesting idea](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001103/2003/01/09.html#a1007) for [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) that solves the problem (multiple browser views supported in one window) that tabbed-browsing tries to solve. I think this *is* more Apple-like than actual tabs would be, and I like the "persistent-between-window-closes" idea too.
