title: Blocking Referer Spam
---
I've been getting a lot of "referers" lately from an unnamed website, so I went in search of ways to block, or at least annoy, them. I found this article from Ed Costello on [Blocking Referer Spam](http://epcostello.net/articles/2004/05/blocking_referer_spam.php). I've implemented a variation on one of his techniques, targetted at this particular spammer. Now to see if it helps.
