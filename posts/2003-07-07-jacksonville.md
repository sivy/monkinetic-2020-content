Jodi and I are in Jacksonville, Fla. helping our with Jodi's grandmother who is recovering from surgery and fighting a battle with cancer. It's a hard experience for the family, watching someone who has been (and is) so respected and loved fight such pain. I'm posting from Jdi's grandmother's AOL connection (56k again!) but I should be on in the complex's computer lab tomorrow (broadband!)
