I'm spending the day writing a proposal for a potential client, for some corporate identity/print/web work. It will be a good project if I can make the proposal attractive enough (financially, and without screwing myself). I absolutely _hate_ writing proposals. I suck at it, it's hard work, but it's absolutely necessary.
