title: Finally, Working History in Sid.
---
Yes, each conversation document in Sid now has a working history. When you post to your site, Sid keeps a copy of the post. You can slide out the history drawer, load a previous post, edit it, and Sid will post the edits to the site, and save them back to the history as well.
