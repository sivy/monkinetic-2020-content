So yesterday was our [Dish Network](http://dishnetwork.com) installation. It was scheduled for between 8 and 12, so I got permission to work remotely yesterday so I could be around. Well, around 11:00 I got a call from the installation dispatcher saying that my installer was running late, and that he would be at the house around 2:00 PM. Annoyed but used to this kind of thing in general, I waited.
