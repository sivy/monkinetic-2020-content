title: XRDS Simple for Movable Type
---
[DiSo](http://diso-project.org) is built on the idea of implementing social networking concepts on existing standards where possible. One of those standards is [XRDS Simple](http://xrds-simple.net/core/1.0/), a service description and discovery format that is a part of several recent and upcoming standards including OpenID and OAuth. This weekend I decided to build a generalized service for Movable Type that implements XRDS.
