XNS, or [eXtensible Naming Service](http://www.xns.org/xns/nutshell.html), is an XML+agent technology. Using XML is great, but XNS seems to have patented the agent technology (idea?) used with the XML. I think this will actually hinder the adoption of what seems to be an otherwise interesting idea. If we have to license XNS's agent patent in order to write compatible applications, then why use XML in the first place? I'm going to watch this one.
