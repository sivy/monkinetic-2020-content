Whoa! Apple announces [AirPort Express](http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/), a power-supply-shaped AirPort base station with a new technology called [AirTunes](http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/airtunes.html) - it will wirelessly stream your itunes to your stereo by way of a 1/8" stereo output jack. Drool factor 5, Mr. Sulu!!

Update: [MacWorld](http://www.macworld.com/) has a bit on how [AirTunes](http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/archives/000212.php) works.
