title: Portal Types and CMSes
---
From the [CMS LIst](http://cms.filsa.net/archives/cms-list/): [This article](http://cmf.zope.org/PTK/Members/jshell/PortalDesigns.txt) by one of [Digital Creations](http://www.digicool.com/)' staff highlights some of the common types of portal sites and their content management needs. Focused on [Zope](http://www.zope.org/)'s [CMF](http://cmf.zope.org/), but can easily be abstracted on-the-fly to CMSes in general.
