[Doc Searls](http://doc.weblogs.com/) has been through some of the same connection hell that we have with [Cox.Net](http://www.cox.net/). He's still [upbeat](http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/02/01#anotherCoxSuckerStory) about it, while we're pretty frustrated. I'm going to try some of his sugggestions, however, and try to remain calm.
_We've been mostly off-line for almost 10 days now_.
