David P. Reed is [discussing](http://www.satn.org/archive/2002_01_20_archive.html#8971522) some fundemental questions about the process of dividing up the radio spectrum to provide "non-interference" between electromagnetic devices.

As is often the case, this great quote applies simultanously to technology and human behavior:

_And the basic question of the limits on "spectrum capacity", as a scientific question, is slowly developing answers - surprising ones. It turns out that network cooperation increases capacity._
