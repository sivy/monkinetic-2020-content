title: Hyatt on Extending HTML
---
A week ago [I commented](http://redmonk.net/2004/07/01/safari-13-search-field) that I wasn't sure about the way Apple was extending HTML in Safari 1.3/2.0. Quite a few others brought up the same point, notably [Tim Bray](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/05/SafariExt) (author of the XML spec).
