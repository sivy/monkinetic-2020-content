Well, one of my best friends [Nate](http://www.nullgel.com) just got laid off from the [company](http://www.compass.net) we both _used_ to work for. No two weeks notice, just "pack up and leave". They've never been great about dealing with their employees, but this is just rotten. Two weeks before Christmas.
