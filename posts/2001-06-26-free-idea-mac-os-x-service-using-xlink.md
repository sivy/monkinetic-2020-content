title: 'Free Idea: Mac OS X service using XLink'
---
Ok, thinking about Smart-Tags-done-right again... Here's a free idea. I'd like to see a Mac OS X service (probably need to be imeplemented in Java) that lets me download libraries of XLinks, then (optionally by using the service) tags words in my documents with a popup menu of possible links. This would build on work done in XLink, make use of existing Java-based [XLink](http://www.xlinkit.com:8080/xtoox/) libraries, and be a total opt-in. Everything, of course, that Smart Tags aren't.
