title: SIFTing Misinformation Online
---
[Sifting Through the Pandemic](https://infodemic.blog/) is a site about how to recognize misinformation on social media, focused -- obviously -- on information about the pandemic. OneZero provides an example in [this article](https://onezero.medium.com/the-simplest-way-to-spot-coronavirus-misinformation-on-social-media-4b7995448071), where someone claiming to be a doctor posted that hand-sanitizer would do nothing to kill the coronavirus (False!).

What I love about the infodemic.blog system (SIFT) is how simple and memorable it is:

- **S**top
- **I**nvestigate the Source
- **F**ind Better Coverage
- **T**race claims, quotes, and media to the original context
