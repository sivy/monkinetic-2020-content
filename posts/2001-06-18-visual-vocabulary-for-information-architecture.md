title: Visual Vocabulary for Information Architecture
---
I've never really considered myself an information architect, but I've done quite a bit of work that would fall into that category over the years. Jesse James Garrett has an excellent article titled [A visual vocabularyfor describing information architecture and interaction design](http://www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/). I've just printed it out and will be perusing offline for a few days.
