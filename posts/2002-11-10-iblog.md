If you use [.Mac](http://www.mac.com/), and want to start a weblog, [Lifli Software](http://www.lifli.com/index.htm) has a solution: [iBlog](http://www.lifli.com/Products/iBlog/main.htm)! After iPhoto came out, I had this same basic idea: an i-themed weblog application. Glad to see someone built it!
