I [just saw](http://support.free-conversant.com/4253) on Conversant's [support site](http://support.free-conversant.com/) that Conversant is not tied directly to Frontier's object database for storing data. Instead, [Macrobyte](http://www.macrobyte.net) has written a database access layer and driver architecture to abstract that away from the groupware app itself.
