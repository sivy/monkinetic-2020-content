---
Our nation is deeply, systematically racist, and no amount of "I'm not like that" changes that. Anti-racism activist Jane Elliott says it perfectly:

> "If you, as a white person, would be happy to recieve the same treatment that our black citizens do in this society, please stand."

> "Nobody's standing here. That says very plainly that you know what's happening, you know you don't want it for you, I want to know why you're so willing to accept it or allow it to happen to others."

_I'm not standing either, and that makes me deeply ashamed._
