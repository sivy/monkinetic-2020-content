Well, I've been pretty quiet lately, especially given the [momentous process](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/category/adoption-week-by-week/) |Jodi| and I are in the middle of. It's now T-2 days until Jodi and I get on a plane bound for London, then to Kiev, Ukraine, to find and adopt our first child! Remarkably, I'm not stressed too much. If you've not been following along, have a browse through Jodi's Adoption Week-by-week posts to catch up. This has been a crazy year, but we have been surrounded by friends and family who have been simply amazing - the level of emotional, spiritual, and financial support has blown us away. Our child will be brought into an environment that is primed and ready for him/her! God is so good!
