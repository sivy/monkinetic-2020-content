[Dave McCusker](http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/new.htm) got himself a shiny new [TiBook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/) a little bit ago, and is [learning the pleasures](http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newJul02.htm#06jul02-yummy) of Mac OS X. I love seeing someone "get it" (no matter what they're "getting"). What a cool thing.
