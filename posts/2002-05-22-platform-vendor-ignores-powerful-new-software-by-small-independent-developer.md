title: Platform vendor ignores powerful new software by small independent developer
---
Our [favorite platform vendor](http://www.scripting.com/) has managed to completely ignore the release of an [incredibly powerful server product](http://conversant.macrobyte.net/) for their platform, one which will drive sales of their platform, and will go far to show the power and flexibility of the platform.
