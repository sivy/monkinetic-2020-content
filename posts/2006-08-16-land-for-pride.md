Scott Adams, the creator of the way-too-like-real-life comic Dilbert, also has a [blog](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/) and has commented a few times on the colloquially named "Middle East Crisis" (with surprising lucidity and insight). Today he [discusses](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/08/yay_both_sides_.html) how both sides can be claiming victory, and gets a bit into cultural matters over there.
