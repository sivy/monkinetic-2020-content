title: Taking my life back
---
Well, it looks like I'm going to be buying a pickup from my brother-in-law, and this morning I bought a [mountain bike](http://www.redmonk.net/516). Finally! I got it pretty cheap, and it's a decent bike. Jodi's going to want me to spend some time getting her bike up to speed, then we can start riding together. ;-) I think we're going to also start going to the [rock gym](http://www.virginiabeachrockgym.com/ROCKGYM/home.htm) again.
