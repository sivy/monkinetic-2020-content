Unfortunately, due to the recent discovery of an [AIM exploit](http://www.w00w00.org/advisories/aim.html), our firewall admin has closed off AIM. Smart move, except that the exploit is specific to the Windows version of the AOL Instant Messenger client - not clones, and not on non-Windows machines. I, on the other hand, use [Adium](http://homepage.mac.com/adamiser/Adium/) on Mac OS X.
