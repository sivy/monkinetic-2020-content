Well, I've *almost* got my import script working well enough to push the button on getting 1729 posts from my blog archives imported into WordPress. It's been hairy, parsing 2400 or so xml files, creating posts and comments from them, and creating the connections between them all. Seeing as it's past midnight and I'm pretty tired, I'm not going to run the script on the live site until I'm certain it's right, but I'm hoping that will be sometime later today. This will mean I've got all my content from June 2000 until the present. I have one more database of posts from late 1999 through June 2000 still to do.
