Don't know when the version changed, but version 0.2 of Aaron Hillegass's Powerpoint replacement [BigShow](http://www.bignerdranch.com/who.html) is out and available for [download](http://www.bignerdranch.com/BigShow_0_2.tar.gz). (Src is [here](http://www.bignerdranch.com/BigShow_0_2src.tar.gz)) BigShow is GPL, "Mac OS X" only, and uses XML as an encoding format.
