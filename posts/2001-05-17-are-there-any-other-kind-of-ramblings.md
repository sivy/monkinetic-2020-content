Whew. It's been a while, but there are times you just have to write. I just read [this lament](http://www.edge.org/documents/adams_index.html) by Richard Dawkins over Douglas Adams' death. Sad, poignant, funny. Reminders that Douglas Adams spoke and lived the same way he wrote. "...The depression uncannily being exactly the same shape as the puddle."
