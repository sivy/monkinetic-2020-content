title: 'Up for air: Avoiding being over-McCuskered'
---
I can't read more then 1/3 of the material on David McCusker's [weblog](http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/new.htm) without coming up for air. It's like being in a parallel dimension, it seems very like our world, but it very much is not. I should add I admire (or at least am greatly intrigued by) Dave a lot.
