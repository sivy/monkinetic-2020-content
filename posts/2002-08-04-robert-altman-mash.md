Thanks of course to the [imdb](http://www.imdb.com/), I recently discovered that the original [M\*A\*S\*H movie](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0066026) was directed by [Robert Altman](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Altman,+Robert). We recently saw [Gosford Park](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0280707), another Altman movie. It was excellent - see it. Heh - M*A*S*H makes more sense now than it did at the time, knowing Altman directed it.
