title: 'Wanted: Liberal Java RSS Parser'
---
Mark Pilgrim was [looking for a liberal RSS Parser](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/13.html#ultraliberal_rss_parser) for Python, I'm now looking for a liberal parser for Java. By liberal I mean that it can handle a large number of types of <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> files as input without borking. It does not mean a parser that cannot handle [Rush Limbaugh](http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/) without borking.
