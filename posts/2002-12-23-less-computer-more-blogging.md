title: Less Computer, More blogging
---
I'm going to kick myself for this later I'm sure (for making commitments I can't, or won't, keep) but I think this next year I'm going to try to sit at the computer less, but get more done while I'm there. This includes blogging, since it's the only writing practice I get, and I need to focus outwards sometimes.
