title: 'New Feature Preview: Daily Digest Emails'
---
I have friends and family for whom RSS is not easy to explain or subscribe to, and who don't really follow blogs in general, but who have expressed an interest in my writing here, such as it is.

So I've hacked up an experimental feature, where I am sending out a nightly email (subscribe in the sidebar) that is comprised of all my posts for the day. Right now the blog posts and notes will be intermixed, so there might be some confusion in the content, it's an ongoing experiment.

If this is something you'd like to try, you can subscribe form in the sidebar of the site or use the [subscribe page](http://eepurl.com/g0G9Ij).
