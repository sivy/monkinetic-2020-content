Via [Creative Bits](http://creativebits.raszl.net/index.html) (of course I [subscribed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/CreativeBits)): Free stock photography from [stock.xchg](http://www.sxc.hu/). There's some very nice stuff here. The cool bit is that not only is the photography free, but you can [register for an account](http://www.sxc.hu/index.phtml?f=reg) and upload your own photography. I haven't looked into it, but it would be awesome if stock.xchg supported [Creative Commons licensing](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/).
