title: Back on the Build
---
Well, after killing bugs for a few weeks, I've got to get back on getting our build process in place. Not the whole thing yet, but I've got to suck the code out of CVS, build a key framework, then do the same for the app. 

Thank goodness for [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit.html), which makes editing shell scripts a highly pleasurable process. (Or as pleasurable as shell script can be).
