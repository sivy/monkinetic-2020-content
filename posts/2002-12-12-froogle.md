I have to admit that it took me a minute to see why the name of Google's news product search site, [Froogle](http://froogle.google.com/froogle), was so apt. &lt;smacks forehead&gt; (via the [Google Weblog](http://google.blogspace.com/archives/000756)) Very very cool though! We've been waiting for this for a long time.
