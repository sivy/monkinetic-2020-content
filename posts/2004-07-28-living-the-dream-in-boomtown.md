In 2002-2003, Jodi and I got seriously hooked on an intelligently-written and smartly-directed crime drama on NBC called [Boomtown](http://epguides.com/Boomtown/). Somehow, aliens managed to abduct the people at NBC smart enough to air this amazing bit of cinema, b/c the show was unceremoniously bludgeoned to death after 1 season and 4 episodes.
