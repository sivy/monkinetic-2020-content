[Sean McMains](http://www.mcmains.net/ruminations) (friend and [Conversant](http://www.free-conversant.com) user) has been [out of work](http://www.mcmains.net/ruminations/2004/03/11#item1029) since March when they closed the office of Electronic Arts where he worked.
&gt; [Woohoo!](http://www.mcmains.net/1067)
Just heard from the University, and they extended me an offer! I should be starting on Monday.
