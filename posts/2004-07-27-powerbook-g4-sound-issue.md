title: Powerbook G4 sound issue
---
If you have a Powerbook G4 and your sound starts horking out, run the Apple Hardware Test (boot from the included disk, hold down Option and select "Apple Hardware Test"). It's possible that you'll get a logic board error `` 2ISS/1/5: 0x40 ``. If so, call AppleCare (you *did* get AppleCare, right?) and they'll hook you up.
