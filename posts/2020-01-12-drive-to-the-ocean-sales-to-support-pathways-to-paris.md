Michael Stipe is selling recordings and videos of his new track, Drive to the Ocean, with much of the proceeds going to [Pathway to Paris](https://pathwaytoparis.com/):

> Pathway to Paris brings together musicians, artists, activists, academics, mayors, and innovators to help raise consciousness surrounding the urgency of climate action and offers solutions to turning the Paris Agreement into action.

Purchased - and would have even if Micheal was putting all the proceeds in his lovely pocket - but I'm really glad to support Pathway to Paris as well.
