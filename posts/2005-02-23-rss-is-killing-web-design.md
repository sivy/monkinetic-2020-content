Ok, now that I've gotten the hysterical hyperbole out of the way, this is what I mean: reading well-designed web sites in an RSS read does *nothing* to stimulate my creative juices. I realized this today after opening a post from [StopDesign](http://www.stopdesign.com/) in Firefox and going "sooooo beautiful! I should *look* at Doug's site more often!" It was then that I realized that reading all my sites in |NetNewsWire|, efficient as it is, is robbing me of the creative kick in the pants I get from browsing and reading [gorgeous](http://www.stopdesign.com/), [beautifully-crafted](http://1976design.com/blog/), [web-standards-based](http://alistapart.com/) websites.
