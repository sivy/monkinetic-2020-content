If you find yourself behind a firewall or filter that blocks popular podcast file servers like libsyn, try out the [Feed Coralizer](http://deliciouslymeta.com/projects/coralizer/coralizer.php). The Feed Coralizer rewrites the feed, routing (mp3/m4a/m4v/wav/aiff/wma/wmv/mov/mp4/mpeg/avi/pdf) files through the [Coral network](http://coralcdn.org).
