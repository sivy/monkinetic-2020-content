I'm a real R.E.M. junkie. I recently got a bunch of iTMS money, and went a bit of a binge: my two best purchases were R.E.M.'s <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=3477362&amp;s=143441" target="_blank" title="In Time on the iTunes Music Store">In Time</a>, and their <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=39306473&amp;s=143441" target="_blank">iTunes Originals</a> collection. I also bought several R.E.M. music videos (Drive, Radio Song, Leaving New York, Near Wild Heaven, Animal, and Find The River). Wooo!<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=3477362&amp;s=143441" target="_blank" title="In Time on the iTunes Music Store">
