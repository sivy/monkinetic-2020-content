I saw O'Reilly's articles on [F-Script](http://www.fscript.org) a while back ([1](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2001/11/30/scripting_fscript.html), [2](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2001/12/21/browsing_cocoa.html)), but had not had time to download and poke around with it. It's pretty sweet, andd the object browser is an incredible means of learning the [Cocoa APIs](http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/index.html). Wow. Have to work with it more now.
