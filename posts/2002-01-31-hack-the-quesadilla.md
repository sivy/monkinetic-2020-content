title: Hack The Quesadilla
---
Got to have dinner last night with old-school Frontier guru, [Peer-to-Peer speaker](http://www.internet2.edu/activities/html/p2pworkshop.html), and all-around [hoopy frood](http://www.systemtoolbox.com/towelday/) [Wes Felter](http://wmf.editthispage.com/). We were headed to find some interesting night spot on Mill Avenue, near ASU, but we were both starving and settled for Chili's.

A fun time was had, however, over an awesome blossom, quesadillas, and a couple fine ales.
