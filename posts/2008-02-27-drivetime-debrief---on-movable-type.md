On my drive home yesterday afternoon I called up BlogTalkRadio's [Cinch](http://cinch.blogtalkradio.com) service and recorded some thoughts on my early experiences with [Movable Type](http://movabletype.org), which I'm looking at while researching some stuff for [DiSo](http://diso-project.org). Topics covered: 



* installing MT on OS X

* general UI

* blog menus v. system menus

* extending Movable Type
