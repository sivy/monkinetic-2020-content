I've recently rediscovered [UIE](http://www.uie.com/)'s blog on User Interface and User Experience issues, [UIE Brain Sparks](http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/). I saw Jared Spool back in '98 at the Thunder Lizard web conference in Atlanta, and was impressed then as well. While I don't agree 100% with UIE's conclusions in every case, I like their approach and attention to detail, and the information is the kind of thing I want to file away for future reference.
