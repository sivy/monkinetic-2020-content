I just noticed that O'Reilly has a [Policy DevCenter](http://www.oreillynet.com/policy/) to go along with their  other developer-oriented sites. I wonder if we'll start to see books like "The Constitution in a Nutshell", "Practical CopyLeft", "Congressional Framework Essentials" showing up on [the booklist](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/prdindex.html)?
