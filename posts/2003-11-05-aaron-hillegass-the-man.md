Recently Aaron Hillegass posted a [pointed diatribe](http://cocoa.mamasam.com/COCOADEV/2003/10/2/75193.php) to the Cocoa-Dev list about Apple's new NSController layer in Mac OS 10.3. Today, he posted an [explanation and partial retraction](http://cocoa.mamasam.com/COCOADEV/2003/11/1/76257.php), showing an astounding amount of mental clarity and humility in the process. Way to go, Aaron!!
