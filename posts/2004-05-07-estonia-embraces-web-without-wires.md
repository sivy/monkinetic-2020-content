[BBC: Estonia embraces web without wires](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3673619.stm). My wife found this cool article about wireless in Estonia - this is very much like the phenomenon in Africa where they skipped installing landline telephone infrastructure b/c it was cheaper for everyone to get cell phones.
