If I get off my butt and start arranging it, I'm hoping to hike part of the Grand Canyon this fall with my brother-in-law. Being a hat-man myself, I immediately decided I would need an appropriate head covering for this adventure. Shelly LeSueur, [Content Connections](http://contentconnections.com)' adventuress-in-residence, suggested [this magnificent-looking hot-weather hiking hat](http://www.sundayafternoons.com/?id=76389732715&amp;sp=adventure) from a company called [ Sunday Afternoons](http://www.sundayafternoons.com/).
