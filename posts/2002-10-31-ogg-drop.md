I'm trying out this little app called [Ogg Drop](http://www.nouturn.com/oggdrop/) - It encodes CD music as [Ogg Vorbis](http://xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/index.html) files (as opposed to MP3, which has a patent/license on it), and supposedly produces smaller and better quality tracks. As soon as it's done I'm going to restart, since I've installed Quicktime 6.0.2, and the [Quicktime decoder ring, er, plugin for Ogg](http://www.illadvised.com/~jordy/), which will let iTunes play Ogg files.
