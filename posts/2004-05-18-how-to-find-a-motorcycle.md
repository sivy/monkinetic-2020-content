title: How to find a motorcycle?
---
I'm looking for (researching, really) a 600cc motorcycle in the Phoenix area. I really like the Honda Shadow VLX, but they seem hard to come by. I'd rather not spend much - part of my motivation is the high cost of gasoline in the valley right now, and if I can get the bike without getting rid of my truck that would be best.
