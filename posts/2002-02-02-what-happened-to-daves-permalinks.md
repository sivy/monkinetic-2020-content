title: What happened to Dave's permalinks?
---
For some reason Dave, from [this link](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/01#hitABump) on down on todays' Scripting News, there are no permalinks on the entries. I'm not logged on as "me" right now so I can't email you. What happened?
