title: Coyotes over Predators
---
This afternoon the [Coyotes beat the Nashville Predators](http://www.azcentral.com/sports/coyotes/0414yotesgamer14-ON.html) to end at 6th place. I never cared about hockey (inspite of
Jim's obsession with it ;-)) until recently - having an NHL team in town is kinda cool. Still, where DO they get names for these teams? I mean, the "Predators"? Oy.
