So... lots going on lately, haven't blogged a bit if it. What's interesting? Userland and others have been building a new weblog API (xml-rpc and soap), and Userland released a new driver-based architecture for Radio Userland. Sounds interesting, but I don't have RU, and my organization is too invested in First Class to look at other information distribution solutions.
