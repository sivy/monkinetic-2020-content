I'm just beginning to work on my own <acronym title="Getting Things Done">GTD</acronym> system, and I'm using OmniOutliner 3 Pro for a good part of my action list management. Since David (Allen, author of ::amazon("0142000280/merlinsblog-20","Getting Things Done")::) recommends using your calendar to manage the hard landscape, I have appointments and such in iCal.
