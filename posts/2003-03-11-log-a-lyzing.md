I've got opus (my dual 200 linux box) chewing through 96mb of apache logs, doing reverse DNS lookups, and combining the separate files into a single file I can feed to [AWStats](http://awstats.sourceforge.net) (I'm using the logresolvemerge.pl script included with awstats). The combined file is up to 218mb right now!
