title: On the importance of backups
---
A couple days ago, a borked config file led me to believe that I had completely hosed my OpenACS setup. I ened up re-installing openacs and the database schema. Luckily, I backed up the templates and some scripts I had customized, so as I get sections of my install backonline I'm mostly able to do it quickly.
