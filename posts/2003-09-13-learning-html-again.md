title: Learning HTML. Again.
---
As I begin to work on writing cleaner HTML, with a goal of proper accessibility and standards compliance, I'm learning about HTML I'd never used before. A good example: I was looking for a way to semantically mark up an FAQ. In another context, I stumbled across definition lists (DL, DT, and DD) which I'd never used or understood.
