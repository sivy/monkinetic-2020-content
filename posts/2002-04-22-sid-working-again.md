Yay! I managed to get [Sid](http://www.redmonk.net/software/Sid), my [Cocoa](http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/index.html)-based Conversant posting utility compiled again. I lost some of the more recent work on it, but I've since changed the way I categorize posts, so the missing functionality is not missed.
