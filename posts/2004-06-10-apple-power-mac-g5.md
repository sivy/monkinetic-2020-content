title: Apple - Power Mac G5
---
Apple announces new [Power Mac G5s](http://www.apple.com/powermac/) today, including a [liquid-cooled](http://www.apple.com/powermac/design.html) dual 2.5 ghz model. I wonder how much power those 2.5 Ghz chips are using? It must be putting off a lot of heat to require a liquid cooling system.
