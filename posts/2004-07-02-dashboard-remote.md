title: Dashboard Remote?
---
Hmmm. Seeing as each [Dashboard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html) gadget is [just a web page](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_06.html#005876), I wonder if they could be delivered remotely? I can envision writing corporate intranet-based gadgets for use by employees on our LAN.
