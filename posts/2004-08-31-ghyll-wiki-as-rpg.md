title: Ghyll, Wiki as RPG
---
Morbus Iff, and a cast of thousands (for a very tiny definition of 'thousands'), have [released](http://www.gamegrene.com/node/397) a new [GameGrene](http://gamegrene.com/) site, [Ghyll](http://gamegrene.com/wiki/Main_Page). Ghyll is a <abbr title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr> where players take on the role of a scholar documenting the history of an imaginary world called Ghyll. Based on the concept documented [here](http://www.20by20room.com/2003/11/lexicon_an_rpg.html), I think this is a really cool idea. Hypermedia rules.
