title: I'm going to hell
---
Today I'm looking to do something I never thought I would do, and am fairly certain that I'm risking hell-fire: I'm looking to install Microsft Visual Basic on my pc. The situation at work has gotten to the point where we are likely to be billed out as M$ platform web developers, so my only chance at survival is to see if there's a way to implement some time-tested ideas in a new (shudder) environment.
