title: Sucker for the romantic comedy

I know, I know. I go into the video store and I can't stomach all the romantic comedies on the shelves. And yet... *[You've Got Mail](http://imdb.com/title/tt0128853/)* comes on TV and I'm sucked into the perky, quasi-intelligent-sounding, annoyingly cute language and plot-lines tailor-made to tug on my heart strings and leave me with that awful feeling that my life will never feel that good.
