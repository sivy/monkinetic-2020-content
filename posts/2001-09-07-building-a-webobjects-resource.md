title: Building a WebObjects Resource

The [WebObjects-talk list](http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/archive/webobjects-talk/) is heating up as developers brainstorm on creating a site (or sites) where developer-to-developer (D2D?) information about WebObjects can be posted/organized. I love this sortof Grassroots self-help stuff.
