title: Patent on Content Publishing granted
---
[eMedicine](www.emedicine.com) has been granted a patent on an [internet-based publishing system](http://www.infotoday.com/it/oct00/news14.htm).  This is not good. I wonder how big the CMS company will have to be to get slapped with licensing or a cease-and-desist letter? [This big](http://www.vignette.com/)? [This big](http://manila.userland.com/)? [This big](http://www.macrobyte.net/conversant/)?
