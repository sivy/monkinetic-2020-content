Well, the Ivy family is adjusting to new realities. Jodi and I are running on between 2-4 hours of sleep for the last two nights, and Adelina has not had much more than that. Jet lag, plus adjusting to new places, new foods, new everything has left our poor little girl a little worse for wear. But when she's doing well, she's truly a joy. :-)
