I'm on the tail end of a 30-hour stretch at work. We had a major, multi-application deployment last night, with everyone from the network administrators to the programmers to the message board admin involved. It was a big deal, and of course my app decided to throw a tantrum precisely 2 minutes before we flip the switch.
