Until making it out to Phoenix, I've been set up with the [First Class](http://www.centrinity.com/) client, so I can access U-Haul's email system and groupware environment. I've never used First Class before, and I'm pretty impressed with it so far. From what I hear it's been this good for 12 years. Soooooo, why is [Exchange](http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.asp) even on the radar?
