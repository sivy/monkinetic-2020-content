Hey, cool. I had the opportunity today to call in and chat with Jerry Schuman on his Techaura podcast. Jerry's a cool guy, and we talked about TiVo, podcasting, TiVo, The Man, and well, TiVo. [Mike Ramsay](http://www.tivo.com/5.2.1.asp), listen up! You can subscribe to Jerry's [Techaura podcast](http://oak.phpwebhosting.com/~theagent/wordpress/wp-rss2.php) with any of the ipodders [listed here](http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/ipodderSoftware).
