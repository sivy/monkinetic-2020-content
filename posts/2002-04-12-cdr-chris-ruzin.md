I was looking through my referer logs today, and noticed a new entry: turns out it's a new blog by an old buddy - [Chris Ruzin](http://www.mantis-design.com/personal/) is another designo-geek I knew back in my days in Germany. Looks like he's back in the states and looking for work: if you need such a one as him, check out his [resume](http://www.mantis-design.com/personal/resume.php3).
