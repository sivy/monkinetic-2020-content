title: Sometimes the experiments don't work
---
Those who know me know I'm a bit of an experimentalist in the kitchen. This evening while trying to find something interesting to put in an omelet, I tried some Indian [ginger pickle](http://www.picklenet.com/sections/cats/recipes/world/indgin.htm). Now I admit this was an odd combination, but you have to admit, you never know unless you try, right?
