Wow. [Clay Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/) is [shredding the telcos](http://www.shirky.com/writings/zapmail.html) and explaining the advantages of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol).
>  A [Vonage](http://vonage.com/) customer can make an unlimited number of unlimited-length domestic long distance calls for their forty bucks, with call waiting, call forwarding, call transfer, web-accessible voicemail and caller ID thrown in free.
