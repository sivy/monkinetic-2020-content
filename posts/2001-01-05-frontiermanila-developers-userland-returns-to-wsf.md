In Userland's latest [screenshot](http://www.scripting.com/images/wizzyEditorMuotd.gif) of MyUserland On The Desktop (isn't this a bit of an awkward name?), I noticed that Userland is once again using .wsf... Anyone have and idea why? The Website Framework extension went out of vogue at Userland and in the community about two years ago, as Manila development progressed (Manila enveloped and superceded the website framework). I'd be interested in why it's making a comeback.
