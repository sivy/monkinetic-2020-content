Looks like [some people](http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0112/06.omniweb.php) are still trying to build a better browser. "With OmniWeb 4.1 you should see some major improvements in compatibility and speed. Our goal is that OmniWeb can be your Mac OS X browser of choice for 100 percent of the web sites you visit." Good on'ya, Omni.
