title: Upgrades on Free-Conversant
---
"Seth" and crew at "Macrobyte" ([Greg Pierce](http://www.turtleprod.com/greg/index) is fingered as the person most responsible ;-)) have given Conversant some [nifty upgrades](http://www.free-conversant.com/free-conversant/support/1558), including the ability to set the MIME type for individual pages, even more message macros, an awesome new search page, and a weblog speed boost.
