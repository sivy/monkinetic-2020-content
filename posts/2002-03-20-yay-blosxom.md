title: Yay Blosxom!
---
I've started using [Blosxom](http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/perl/blosxom/) for a small local-to-my-desktop internal work-related blog. It's not a fancy blogtool, but it's not a fancy blog. I write up in [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/) what i want to say, and save it to my blosxom directory. "Too easy drill sargeant!" Go [Rael](http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/)!
