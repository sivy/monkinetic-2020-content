title: Introducing My Power Learning
---
[Content Connections](http://www.contentconnectionc.com) (the company I work for) is launching a new online learning tool called [My Power Learning](http://www.mypowerlearning.com). MPL is a learning style preference assessment - it helps students (especially) as well as parents, educators, or anyone - understand the modes in which they learn and communicate. The assessment is followed by a lengthy and personalized report that explains how you can study and communicate better, based on what you now know about your own learning style.
