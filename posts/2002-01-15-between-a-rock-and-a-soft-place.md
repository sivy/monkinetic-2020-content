title: Between a rock and a soft place
---
Jodi and I found a cool rock gym about 10 minuted from our house - it's also easy to get to from work so on my way home this evening I stopped by and bouldered for an hour or so. Oy! My poor noodle-soft arms! I am NOT in shape, and since Arizona has some of the best climbing in the US, I figured I better get back into shape.
