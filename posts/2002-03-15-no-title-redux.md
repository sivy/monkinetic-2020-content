I [posted yesterday](http://www.redmonk.net/2002/03/12#item1071) a response to some comments by Doc Searls at SXSW. [Jim responded](http://www.redmonk.net/1072), which prompted me to respond again. I think my response was one of my better explanations of my political leanings, so I've formalized it [here](http://www.redmonk.net/stories/noTitle). Seth also had [some comments](http://www.truerwords.net/1785) worth checking out.
