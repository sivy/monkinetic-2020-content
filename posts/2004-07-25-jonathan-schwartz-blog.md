title: Jonathan Schwartz' blog
---
Sun Microsystem's CEO, Jonathan Schwartz, [has a blog](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/). Now, I don't care a heck of a lot about what's going on at Sun, but I am enjoying hearing about life from Jonathan's <abbr title="Point Of View">POV</abbr>. Largely he's using the blog to address issues that are facing Sun these days, like [how they are going to monetize Java](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20040712#commodities_railroads_and_how_sun), or [how to compete with "Free" software](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20040721#competing_against_a_social_movement).
