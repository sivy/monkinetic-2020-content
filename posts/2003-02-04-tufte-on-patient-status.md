title: Tufte on patient status

[Graphical summary of patient status](http://www.edwardtufte.com/506776375/tufte/lancet_p1) (1994): Very cool article from the Lancet (medical journal) reproduced on [Tufte's site](http://www.edwardtufte.com/), in which Tufte and a collaborator define a simple graphical representation of patient status information. Brilliant. Tufte packs more information and meaning into a two-dimensionsal space than anyone I've seen.
