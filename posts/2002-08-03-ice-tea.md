I heard a great story on NPR today: [Making the Perfect Iced Tea](http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/aug/icedtea/index.html). Although I grew up in Virginia, my parents were both from elsewhere - so I didn't grow up with a traditional Southern Ice Tea tradition. However, my mother did turn me onto one great thing: "sun tea".
