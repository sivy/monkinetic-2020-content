Well, I am officially IM-less at work for the foreseeable future (and probably slightly beyond that). Our network guys are very security conscious and I don't fault them for it. The AIM protocol has been closed on the firewall.

So, I'm back to email, which in true internet fashion, seems so... _slow_. ;-)

In the evenings from home, however, I'll be on AIM, and probably \#p2p-hackers as well. _monkinetic_ or _redmonk_.
