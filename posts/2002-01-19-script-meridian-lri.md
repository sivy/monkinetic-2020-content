Through an interesting twist of link I ended up on the old [Script Meridian](http://www.scriptmeridian.org/) website today. For old times sake I trawled throught [DOODADS](http://www.scriptmeridian.org/doodads/), and came across what is probably the last [Frontier](http://frontier.userland.com/) script I ever released. [Load Regexed Images](http://www.scriptmeridian.org/doodads/LoadRegexedImages.html) would let you give it a regex to apply to a folder of images, and load any image that matched the regex into Frontier's [object database](http://static.userland.com/frontierImages/davenetedit.gif). I was hacking Frontier a lot back then - _8/7/1998_. ([Background](http://redmonk.net/archives/2002/01/11/radio-userland-tools/3))
