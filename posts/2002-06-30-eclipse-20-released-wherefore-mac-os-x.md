title: Eclipse 2.0 released, wherefore Mac OS X?
---
Eclipse 2.0 has been released. [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) is a Meta-IDE, an integrated development environment for programmers that can be configured to work with most any language/runtime. You can download 2.0 [here](http://64.38.198.171/downloads/), but I'm wondering what would need to be done to get a copy running on Mac OS X. There are Win32 and native X Windows versions... but it seems there's no (at elast) Pure Java version.
