title: IM for Radio Userland
---
Jim just released [an outline-based IM suite](http://jim.roepcke.com/3493) for Userland's [outliner](http://radio.userland.com). Jim developed this back in January 2000... I *think* I had a chance to play with it - if the memory I'm dredging up is accurate, it was pretty cool. ;-)
