Peggy Noonan - [The Blogs Must Be Crazy](http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006302&amp;ojrss=frontpage). She makes a ton of good points, for example:

&gt;In newspapers you have to go to the editor, explain to him why the paper should have another piece on the Eason Jordan affair, spend a day reporting it, only to find that all that's new today is that reporter Michelle Malkin got an interview with Barney Frank. That's not enough to merit 10 inches of newspaper space, so the Times doesn't carry what the blogosphere had 24 hours ago. In the old days a lot of interesting information fell off the editing desk in this way. Now it doesn't.

This is an inspiring article.   Thanks [Seth](http://www.truerwords.net/4564)! (Oh, and [Dave](http://archive.scripting.com/2005/02/17#When:8:25:44AM) too.)
