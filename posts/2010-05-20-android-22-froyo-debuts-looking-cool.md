title: Android 2.2 &quot;Froyo&quot; Debuts - Looking Cool
---
Google announced the new release of its mobile/embedded OS, Android, at its I/O developer conference. The [new features](http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.2-highlights.html) look pretty good - I'm looking forward to seeing them in the wild, and I think that it's great for us Apple users to see someone else pushing the envelope in the mobile handset space.
