title: Moleskine notebooks
---
I'd never heard of [Moleskine notebooks](http://www.moleskine.co.uk/main.html), but they seem to have quite the reputation. I've long used hardbound unlined notebooks as sketchbooks and journals. Now I find that [these really cool bound notebooks](http://www.moleskine.co.uk/gallery.html) can be [purchased online](http://www.mojolondon.co.uk/Products/moleskine_large.html).
