title: My brother is a badass
---
My brother designs and creates graphics for trade show booths and TV backdrops. On a recent project for the US Army, his backdrop mural (all CG and photo compsiting) triggered an interesting legal reaction...

&gt; the Army's PR department feels they have to disclaimer it in the booth that it's "a depiction, not a real photo."
