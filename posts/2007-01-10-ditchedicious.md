I've ditched [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/redmonk), and imported all my links into <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/people/SteveIvy" rev="vote-for">ma.gnolia</a>, based largely on an interview with [Tara Hunt](http://www.horsepigcow.com/) (of community marketing studio [Citizen Agency](http://citizenagency.com/)) by [Brian Oberkirch](http://www.brianoberkirch.com/?p=787). The site is very nicely designed, the link bookmarklet works well, and they have ratings on links. (Hm, Perhaps I should recommend they add [vote-links](http://microfrmats.org/wiki/vote-links) support...)
