Been thinking a lot the last few days about how privileged my family is to be able to effectively shelter in place here in the suburbs, with most everything we need at hand. And I don't expect even this to completely protect us. Thinking about those who don't have physical, economic, societal access to safe environments. 😞 #covid19
