title: Music video for the info geek
---
[Via [Aaron](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000463)] Music video from Royksopp, "You Remind Me". The video is done in classic "infopgraphic" style, following an office worker's day. This is one of the most innovative things I've seen in ages, even if the music is fairly classic euro-techno-pop. (Catchy though).
