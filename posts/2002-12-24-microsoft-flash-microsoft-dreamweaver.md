title: Microsoft Flash? Microsoft Dreamweaver?
---
According to [Dave](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/12/22#When:9:59:36AM), the Register is [reporting](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/28667.html) thatMicrosoft may want to buy Macromedia, makers of Flash, Freehand, Dreamweaver, and other graphics and web applications. Evidently they want Flash MX, so it can become YAJK (Yet Another Java Killer) on the web.
