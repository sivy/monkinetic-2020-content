Well, yesterday Jodi and I [went hiking](http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/01/02#item1675) with her cousins, Brady and Carly. This morning I got up and went [mountain biking](http://www.az-fattire.com/trails/phoenix/desert_classic.shtml) with them. I've not had this much cardio-vascular exercise in ages, and I'm feeling it!
