Dave on NetNewsWire's recent support for scripting:
>  For what it's worth, of course, Radio's aggregator has had infinite extendibility with scripts for a long time, on Mac OS X, with AppleScript, etc etc. ([link](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/12/04#When:4:11:49AM))
Yes, Dave, but NetNewsWire is a full Mac OS X app, not a Mac OS X shell on a Mac OS 8 app with a Mac OS 7 interface. It also runs, without crashing, for days on end, and without ever making a [bump](http://www.romanvenable.net/index/2002/09/21#post149) on the [performance meter](http://radio.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$7838?mode=topic).
