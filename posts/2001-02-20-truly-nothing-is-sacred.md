*Sigh*. Network Solutions is now [selling all the information in the whois database](http://public.wsj.com/sn/y/SB982282009562632162.html) to direct marketers. If you've ever registered a domain name, direct marketers will now be able to target you based on any information you've entered in the registration database, as well as how long your site has been up, if you're doing ecommerce, if your domain is active or not... damn.
