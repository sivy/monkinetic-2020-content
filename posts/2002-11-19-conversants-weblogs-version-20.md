> Conversant's Weblog 2.0 plugin is finally ready for very early pre-release testing. I'm going to call this "alpha" testing, instead of beta, as many features -- ones that haven't been discussed outside of Macrobyte -- have not yet been fully implemented.
> ...
> Work on the plugin up to this point has been all about making it work __right__, and making it __powerful__. Making it __fast__ comes last.
