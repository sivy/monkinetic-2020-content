I've been using [Launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html)  from [Objective Development](http://www.obdev.at/) for a few weeks now. All I can say is... *DAAamn*. That's a FINE pice of software. Launchbar indexes all your applications and documents (all configurable) and then gives you access to each of them in as little as 3 keystrokes.
