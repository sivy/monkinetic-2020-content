title: David Hyatt on Gecko (Mirrored)
---
[jmtee](http://jmtee.blogspot.com/) has a [blog entry](http://jmtee.blogspot.com/2003_01_01_jmtee_archive.html#87297674) where he mirrors some of [David Hyatt](http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/)'s ([Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) team member) comments regarding why Apple went with KHTML over the Gecko rendering engine. David has since taken down his post, so there's some question as to why, but the stuff jmtee mirrored is insightful.
