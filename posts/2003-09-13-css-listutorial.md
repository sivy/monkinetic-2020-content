Russ Weakley (of [Max Design](http://www.maxdesign.com.au)) [responds](http://www.redmonk.net/2301) to my previous comments about the lists on the Max Design site. He also kindly points us to a [new tutorial](http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/listutorial/) he's put together on using background images with CSS to build even more creative lists.
