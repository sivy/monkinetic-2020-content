[Doc](http://doc.weblogs.com) has a really cool [article](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5715&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0) over on Linux Journal, reporting from MacWorld. BTW Doc, I think someone already has the Ox, I'm not sure. (I can see it in my head, but for the life of me I can't remember where to look for it.)
