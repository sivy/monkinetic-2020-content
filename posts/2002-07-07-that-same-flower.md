Jodi and I went to the central [Phoenix Library](http://phoenixlibrary.org/web/) today, to pick up several books. We left with the two I needed, plus one other of interest: [That Same Flower](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374253846/redmonknet-20/104-4315644-0661538), by Jostein Gaarder ([review](http://www.edsbookreview.com/general/gaarder_that_same.html)).
