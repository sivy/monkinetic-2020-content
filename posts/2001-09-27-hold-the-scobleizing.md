title: Hold the Scobleizing
---
I used to follow Robert Scoble's blog: [Scobleizer](http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/) regularly, when he was a conference organizer and respectful M$ apologist. Since joining [Userland](http://www.userland.com/) as Marketing guru, it seems like [every](http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/2001/09/25) [other](http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/2001/09/27) day is a Userland ad.
