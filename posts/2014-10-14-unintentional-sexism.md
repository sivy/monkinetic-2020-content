[Ways Men in Tech are Unintentionally Sexist](http://notapattern.net/2014/10/14/ways-men-in-tech-are-unintentionally-sexist/). I'm in the process of re-educating myself on these issues. If it isn't your thing, it should be. If you've been on the receiving end of this and want to talk about it, [feel free to get in touch](mail:steveivy@gmail.com). If you've been on the receiving end of this kind of this and I was the oaf dishing it out, [even more so](mail:steveivy@gmail.com).
