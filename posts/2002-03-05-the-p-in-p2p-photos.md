[John Robb wants a P2P photo app](http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/02/28.html#a1273):
>  Sharing photos is still too hard. I can send photos via e-mail or post a couple to the Web, but I can't easily share whole albums with friends and family. What I want is a desktop content management system that lets me organize my photos into albums using a browser interface. I then would like to share these albums with friends and family using P2P.
