title: Apple provides patch for Document Controller
---
Apple is providing a [source code patch](http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1039.html) for applications using Cocoa's Document Architecture. The functionality will be patched system-wide in a Mac OS X update later on. This is the first time _I've_ seen this kind of thing from Apple. Right on.
