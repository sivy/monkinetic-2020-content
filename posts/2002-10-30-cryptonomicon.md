Well, I finished Neil Stephenson's [Crytonomicon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380973464/qid=1035932208/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-5996147-3882535?v=glance). It's a LONG book - 900 pages. It took me approximately 15 hours to read it - that's actual reading time, and it's an estimate since I generally read about 60 pages an hour, or a page a minute. That's not terribly fast (IMO) but it's pretty fast.
