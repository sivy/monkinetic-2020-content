Sean Gallagher on Microsoft's [SDP](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2001/Jun01/06-19sdpPR.asp): "Bill Gates said that Microsoft would still be the one to "productize" anything that comes out of the SDP. In other words, Microsoft would consume the brainpower of its clients, and sell it back to them as software and services."
