title: Email Error reporting now works
---
I finally got Sid's Applescript-powered email error reporting working today. It took ages to get it all right; it took getting the Applescript right, then making sure the Sid's Application Support folder was created, then writing out the error file, then finally reading in the script, filling in the parameters, can calling it. It works!!!
