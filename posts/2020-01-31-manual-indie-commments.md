[Chris Aldrich](https://boffosocko.com) wrote a blog post about [manually adding Webmentions for links to his posts](https://boffosocko.com/2020/01/30/manual-backfeed-in-the-blogosphere/) from sites that are not themselves Webmention-enabled.

This reminded me that I'd like to add a "I linked to you" feature for the post detail page in #goldfrog for this site. (Goldfrog *does* support Webmentions, so Chris should get an automatic link from this post :))
