title: .NET Primer for Mac users
---
Charles Wiltgen, (former?) Quicktime product manager, offers[ this .NET primer for Mac users](http://wiltgen.net/articles/dotnet/). Why .NET is going to affect us, and why it can be a Good Thing(tm).

It's a good read, very basic, and he makes some very good points. I'll have to finish the article before passing judgement, but read it for yourself and see what _you_ think.

Best line: _It's the end of Windows as we know it, and I feel fine._
