Dave has put up a fast loading version of Scripting News, as their static server is down. I have to admit whenever I see this version of Scripting News, I'm taken back to 1996, '97 when SN was small and fast. It makes me want to rip the images off my site and strip it down to nothing. _FAST FAST FAST!_
