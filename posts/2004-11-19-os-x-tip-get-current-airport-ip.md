title: 'OS X Tip: Get Current Airport IP'
---
I got a bit of help from the denizens of IRC (crschmidt, kpried) in creating a little bit of shell code that, when run, will get the current IP address of `` en0 `` (on my Powerbook that's the Airport) and 1) put it on the clipboard, and 2) print it out. This should go on one line in your `` .bash_profile ``.
