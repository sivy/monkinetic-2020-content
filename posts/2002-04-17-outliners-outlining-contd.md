Note to [Dave ](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/16#l1bb7976275c8fb839a2df96a4370343a) - Mark may have said he does not like outliners; however, he DOES understand the [power of an outliner](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/04/16.html#outlines_vs_outliners):
>  I like to edit Python code in an IDE (or in Emacs in python-mode), which autoindents for me and allows me to "fold" code blocks (collapse an outline node) that I'm not currently using.
He's already got what you're offering him in Radio's outliner (the one Frontier programmers all love)- but without the ability to easily edit that same script in some other text editor.
