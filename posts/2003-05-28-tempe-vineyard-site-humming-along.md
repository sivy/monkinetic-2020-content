title: Tempe Vineyard site humming along

A while back I finished up and launched a new site for our church, the [Tempe Vineyard](http://www.tempevineyard.com). Jodi and I are the defacto webmasters, which is fine with us. It's giving us the exciting opportunity to be the web evangelists within the church, helping members and leaders understand  they have at their disposal.
