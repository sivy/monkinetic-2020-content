title: Goodbye, UserLand.
---
For several years, from about 1996 to 1999, [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com) and [UserLand Software](http://userland.com) were a huge portion of my daily life. I was creating websites and scripting tools in [Frontier](http://frontier.userland.com/), reading [Davenet](http://davenet.scripting.com/), Scripting News, the frontier users' mailing lists. I'm pretty sure I dreamt in [usertalk](http://frontier.userland.com/manual/userTalk) a few times, and I was well indoctrinated with the [culture of outlining](http://www.outliners.com/).
