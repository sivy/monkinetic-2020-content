title: Roepcke for Hire
---
Jim is "[urgently in need of work](http://jim.roepcke.com/2002/01/23#item4035)". If you need an awesome coder, a great mentor, or all-around great guy in your company, [check him out](http://www.roepcke.com/resume/). 

Be aware - Jim needs to work remotely, and he's by far the one I would bet one if I could hire a teleworker. He's motivated, creative, and productive.
