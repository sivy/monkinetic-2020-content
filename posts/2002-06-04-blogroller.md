OK, I finally got around to creating and populating a blogroll over at [blogrolling.com](http://www.blogrolling.com). I know it's a fad perhaps, but I can't help it. (For those who don't know, a blogroll is a list of other blogs you read, and want to link to as a sign of respect.) The cool thing is that I now include my blogroll on this page via the [RSS version](http://www.blogrolling.com/br/rss.php?r=7318f359722ae64ccc8a8b984f830ced) of it. Now *that's* nifty.
