title: New Feedster, sponsored links, and *the other* Steve Ivy
---
Well, shoot. I had finally kicked [this Steve Ivy](http://apps.heritagecoin.com/wordfromsteve.php) off the first few pages of [Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=steve+ivy&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8),  now he (well, his company Heritage Coin) has purchased a well-placed sponsored [link ](http://www.heritagecoin.com/index_ov.asp?type=overture+steve+ivy&amp;target=steve+ivy)on the new [Feedster](http://feedster.com). Yeargh! Foiled again!
