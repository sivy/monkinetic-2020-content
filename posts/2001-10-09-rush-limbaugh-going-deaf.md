title: Rush Limbaugh going deaf
---
I was just listening to [Rush Limbaugh](http://www.rushlimbaugh.com) - something I hardly ever do anymore, since he's more of a blowhard now than ever... but I was in the car running errands earlier, and tuned in. It turns out Rush is going deaf, and has been for many months. He's wearing hearing aids now, and if his current medications do not help, he will probably be 100% deaf in a month or so.
