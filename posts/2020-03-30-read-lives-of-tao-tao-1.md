Having first read the [Io books](http://monkinetic.blog/2020/03/23/read-the-rise-of-io-io-1), I finally realized that the Tao books (which I had been skipping in the library list of scifi books for a couple of years, why I do not know) were set 20 years earlier in the same universe and introduced about half the characters.

The Quasing Wars world is *really* fun to read, and the relationships that Tao and Io have with their hosts are both similar and *entirely* different.
