title: 'Whoa: Drag to subscribe to Podcast in iTunes'
---
Not sure if this is new in [iTunes](http://apple.com/itunes/) 6, but on whim I tried dragging a link to [Merlin](http://43folders.com)'s new podcast onto the "Podcasts" group in iTunes. *Boom* - it subscribed to the podcast and started to download the most recent show. *Apple rocks*.
