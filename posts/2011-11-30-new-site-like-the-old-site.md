title: 'New site: kinda like the old site'
---
After procrastinating for many months, I've finally moved [this site](http://monkinetic.com) off of Typepad and into [Octopress](http://octopress.com) the fancy-pants [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) variant. This is no means any kind of indictment of Typepad -- it's a great platform that has served me well for a few years. But it was time for a change: the hacker, poker, and pusher-of-buttons in me needed a new platform to hack, poke, and push on.
