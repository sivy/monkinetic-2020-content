I found out that the bike shop I went to for years (1988 - 1996, when I stopped riding frequently) has a [website](http://www.hdkcycles.com/). These guys are really knowledgeable. I'm looking for a shop closer to my neighborhood, but if I don't find one, I'm making these guys my shop of choice once again.
