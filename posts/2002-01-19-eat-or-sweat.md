I have a quandry: Jodi and I have been invited to a friends house for dinner tonight with a bunch of other people (many of whom I'm thinking we will not know). I think it might be fun to go, but I don't do extended social engagements as well as Jodi does. I'm more inclined to [go bouldering](http://redmonk.net/archives/2002/01/14/between-a-rock-and-a-soft-place/) at my favorite rock house. What to do?
