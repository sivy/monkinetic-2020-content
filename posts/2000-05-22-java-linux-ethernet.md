Man. It's been toooooooo long. I'm finally wrapping up the interminable freelance job, and I realized (actually my wife reminded me) that I haven't blogged here in ages. This had to be fixed!

I have, actually, been blogging some at [another site](http://www.redmonk.net/camblog/) that some co-workers and I put together. I guess I was inspired by the [makers of](http://www.pyra.com/) [BLOGGER](http://www.blogger.com/) by whose magic the [CamBlog](http://www.redmonk.net/camblog/) came to life one day. Yes, the CamBlog, affectionately titled "GeekTV", is a combo-box of a weblog/webcam. It will soon be added to the template of this site, somewhere...

Speaking of BLOGGER, using it is a completely different experience from using "Manila". It's more... technical. But very powerful in as far as it goes. Blogger does one thing well- Blogs. Manila is much more flexible- it's the CMS face to "Frontier".

"Josh" has gotten "XML-RPC" working in Turbine, an apache/Java/Servlets thing. I'm not sure I understand the recent proliferation of Apache/Java projects recently. [Turbine](http://java.apache.org/turbine/index.html), [Cocoon](http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/index.html), [Jetspeed](http://java.apache.org/jetspeed/site/overview.html), [WebMacro](http://www.webmacro.org/)...

[WebMacro](http://www.webmacro.org/) looks interesting. I wonder how it might compare to "Frontier"'s template system? _In my mind, Frontier set the standard for seperating content and presentation in web systems._

One thing Java needs to get before I can begin to build a truly great system in it: [persistent, structured storage](http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1132). Java could do it, but to be high performance, it would probably have to be native code and interface through JNI. _I bet the purists wouldn't like it.I'm just beginning to get interested in some of this Java+web+xml stuff. Gotta get some free time to explore. _Ha!__

Our home is a [90-year old Victorian](http://weblogs.userland.com/the259diaries); we're slowly making plans to renovate this and that, knocking out some walls and adding others. [This article](http://www.arstechnica.com/guide/networking/installation-1.html) on Ars Technica looks like it'll be really helpful. With Macs in the bedrooms and Linux under the stairs, there'll be joy for everyone!
