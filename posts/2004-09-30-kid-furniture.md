Jodi and I found a small antique dresser that needs a bunch of work done on it. I've already started stripping and sanding the old finish off, and we'll be painting it up to go with the (as yet to be determined) color scheme for LT's room. I'm enjoying it too, as it gives me something special I can create/restore for my future son!
