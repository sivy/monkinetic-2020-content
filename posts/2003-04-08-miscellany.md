*   Thanks to Scoble linking to [this post](http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/04/05#item1984), I'm now \#41 on [Popdex](http://www.popdex.com). I'll be gone in a couple days, but it's been fun!
*   TidBITS is [looking for a CMS](http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-675.html#lnk3), [Zope](http://www.zope.org)/[Plone](http://www.plone.org) mentioned as a possibility.
*   I rode 16 miles yesterday, in 1 hour, 20 minutes. My longest ride this year.
