Mmmm, an RSS news aggregator for your [iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod).
>  ... why not keep yourself amused on the bus by reading the latest headlines from your favourite news sites? ... Wouldn't it be great if you could put some of it on your iPod? We thought the answer was yes, and so PodNews was born. ([link](http://www.clichesw.com/podnews/))
I wondered when [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) introduced the iPod why it had such a generic name... I guess by now we know! Go Apple!
