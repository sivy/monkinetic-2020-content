title: Hallelujah I'm Bourne-Again
---
Some [light reading](http://www.gnu.org/manual/bash/html_node/bashref_toc.html) today. I'm working on a set of build scripts that rely on the behavior of bash; running them in my previous favorite shell - tcsh - produced less-than-desirable results. So, I found bash for OS X [here](http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley-Oakland/2986/macosx/pkgs.html) and installed it.
