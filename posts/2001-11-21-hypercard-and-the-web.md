_What if you could design, create and edit a stack in a single outline? That's what I have working. Instead of the runtime being Hypercard, the runtime is the Web. _

I have a problem with this... I learned to program using HyperCard and HyperTalk. What Dave has working is HyperTalk in an outline, with placeholders for GUI elements. Frontier has a great outliner. I won't dispute it. But an outliner is not the place to develop visual interfaces.
