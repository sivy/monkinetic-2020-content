I wanted to get Python 2.2 on my Mac OS X box... so I installed [Fink](http://fink.sourceforge.net), which is a package management system for Darwin. The process is pretty easy - pick your components, Fink tells you what the dependencies are, and it downloads and installs it all for you. Not a surprise to most linux users, but this is new to me on Mac OS X.
