title: Waiting on the SteveNote
---
Like the rest of the Apple/Mac world, I'm waiting for the [WWDC SteveNote](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/). What will His Steveness, Dark Lord of the Black Turtleneck unveil? How many Bothans have died to bring us the[ Apple/Intel rumors](http://feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=apple+intel&amp;sort=date)? Will the sacrifice be in vain?
