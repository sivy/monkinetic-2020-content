title: .NET on OS X
---
Halcyon Software [is bringing .NET](http://www.businesswire.com/cgi-bin/f_headline.cgi?bw.071801/211990338) to Mac OS X. They are actually converting Microsoft's Intermediate Language (like Java's bytecodes) to Java .class files or source code, and will be providing the complete ASP.NET (including ADO.NET and WebForms) later this year.  

" Halcyon is currently working with selected customers on deploying ASP.NET projects to the OS X environment. It expects to move into a formal Beta in October 2001." Cooool.
