title: Redmonk Development going to MacWorld Expo - San Fransisco
---
This afternoon I registered, along with Jodi, for the [MacWorld Expo](http://www.macworldexpo.com) in San Fransisco. Wooooohooooo!!! I have always wanted to be at one of these events. So, Jan 9th through the 14th we'll be on the left coast, checking out San Fransisco and all that's new in the Mac Universe. ;-)
