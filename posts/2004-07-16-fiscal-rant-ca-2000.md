title: Fiscal Rant, ca. 2000
---
Now that I've got all my archives imported, I was watching the apache logs scroll by when the [MSNBot](http://search.msn.com/msnbot.htm) requested this [rant from Oct. 2000](http://redmonk.net/archives/2000/10/10/the-anti-brent). It's got me wondering if my thoughts on the matter have changed any in 4 years. More on that later.
