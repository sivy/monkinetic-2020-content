"Tech" practices problem-space-reduction to reach MVP, reducing messy, complex, human situations to linear engineering problems, optimized for what "works in most cases" where "most cases" is bounded by systemic and institutional bias (including systemic racism).

> Systemic bias is an inseparable part of organizational culture, the common pattern of thinking that goes with it, and the premises by which all human systems function. Therefore each of us has a systemic bias. However, we may be unaware of its unstated assumptions. [compression institute, 2011](https://compression.org/systemic-bias/)

Hence, "Tech" makes many things far, far worse.
