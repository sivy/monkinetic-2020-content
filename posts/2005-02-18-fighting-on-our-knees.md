|Jodi| just posted a great summary of current events and call to prayer for all of our believing friends and family. [Fighting On Our Knees](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/archives/2005/02/17/fighting-on-our-knees) is a look into the arbitrary workings of the Ukrainian bureaucracy, and the seeming randomness affecting our adoption process. Please join us in prayer!
