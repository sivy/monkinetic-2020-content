title: Dan Bricklin on the TabletPC
---
[Dan Bricklin](http://danbricklin.com/) (of VisiCalc fame) just bought a TablePC and [shares his thoughts](http://danbricklin.com/log/tabletpc.htm) on it. Here's [Acer's version](http://www.acer.com/APP/AKC/INTERNET/AACPubli.nsf/HeadingPagesDisplay/ProductsTablet+PC?OpenDocument&amp;ML1.3&amp;), and here's [Toshiba's](http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/pc/pc_tabletPcDetail.jsp?comm=CS) (which Dan actually bought).
