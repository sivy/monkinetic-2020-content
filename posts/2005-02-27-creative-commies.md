It's been a while since I've jumped on a bandwagon late, but I thought [this t-shirt](http://www.giantrobotprinting.com/commies/) was really funny, so I ordered one this past week. For background, see [this Boing Boing post](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/05/bill_gates_free_cult.html), and [this one](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/06/more_gates_creative_.html) too.
