Following a [megnut link](http://www.megnut.com/archive.asp?which=2003_01_01_archive.inc#002416) about a job listing Meg posted to Craig's List, I found that the [Craig's List](http://www.craigslist.org/) site is really cool. It seems to be a site that allows the creation of online communities - there's a big one for [New York](http://newyork.craigslist.org/), one for [Phoenix](http://phoenix.craigslist.org/), etc. I think I'm going to add this site to my collection of places to look for jobs. I noticed that the few postings I looked at were written in a person's voice - not the Recruiter-droid&amp;trademark lingo you hear on most other job sites.
