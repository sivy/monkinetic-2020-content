As a few of my readers may have discerned, I've gotten a bit obsessed with [microformats](http://microformats.org/wiki/what-are-microformats) lately. Microformats are simple ways to add machine (searchengine, browser-plugin)-readable information to normal, XHTML-based web pages. They are designed to be simple so that they are easy for authors and publishers to add to their content rather than having to support separate, more verbose content formats.
