title: Tales Of WO coming back to life
---
Jim and I and another guy started Tales Of Wo a while back, but I've let it languish. Well, I've begun working my way back into WebObjects, and with this new found energy comes new desire to share it with whomever may care to read it. So, if you're learning WebObjects, want to, or just want to witness me floundering from time to time, hop on over to Tales Of WO.
