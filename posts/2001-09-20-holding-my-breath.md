title: Holding My Breath
---
In [Up For Air](http://www.redmonk.net/683), I commented that I could only absorb Dave McCusker's writings in short bursts. I've been following him more closely the last couple days, practicing as it were. I can "hold my breath" in his parallel universe for longer now - a couple weeks worth of postings. Maybe one day I'll be able to breathe there?
