title: A Screenplay in the Family
---
Jodi's family (parents and younger brother) just got into town. SkyHarbor Airport was (as to be expected) a madhouse, but we successfully managed to find them, reunite them with their luggage, and get them home. Since being out here, we've reallly missed family, so it's really really nice to have them here!
