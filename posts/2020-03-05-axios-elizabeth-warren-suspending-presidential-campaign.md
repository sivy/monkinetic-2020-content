It's not showing up on [Elizabeth Warren](https://elizabethwarren.com/)'s site yet, but [Axios is reporting](https://www.axios.com/elizabeth-warren-campaign-drops-out-8fcbba79-38bf-4eea-bc7c-4a06a15d975a.html) that Warren is suspending her presidential campaign. I'm heartbroken -- she was the smart, tough candidate that actually inspired me.

_Senator Warren: Thank you for your leadership, your humility, your willingness to hold those in power accountable. You would have been an incredible president. Keep fighting for Americans and for what America should stand for._
