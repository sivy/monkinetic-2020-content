[Resident Advisor reviews the new Claro Intelecto compilation](https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/24564):

> Some say dance music lacks heart. This compilation might be among the best responses to that claim.

I'd never heard of this artist until I started listening to the track linked from the review, and I *really* like it. Will be digging into these compilations, and more of his back catalog as well.
