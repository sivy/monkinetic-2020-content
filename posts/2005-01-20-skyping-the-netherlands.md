title: Skyping The Netherlands

I'm on the horn on [Skype](http://skype.com) (a voice-over-ip softphone)  with [Robert Kloosterhuis](http://www.geekswithblogs.net/jemimus) from the Netherlands. Robert is one of the participants in [Kevin Devin](http://www.kevindevin.com/)'s Tech Chat podcast, which I listen to religiously, so it's cool to get to know him a bit better.
