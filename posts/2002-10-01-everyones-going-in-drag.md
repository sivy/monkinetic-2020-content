[via [Michael McCracken - Weblog ](http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog)] >  &lt;&lt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE: ...A key part of this is the simple things like making sure drag-and-drop and copy-and-paste work between all these different apps.I agree. Brent's [RSS clipboard format spec](http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/rssclipboard.php) looks solid, and will definitely be a useful contribution. 
 I dragged the above quote from NetNewsWire into Blapp, which doesn't use Brent's clipboard format (but works for me). My question to Blapp users is this: would it be worthwhile to add support for this?
