Jodi and I went with my new boss David and his wife Kristy to see the live taping of [NPR](http://www.npr.org)'s [Wait, Wait Don't Tell Me](http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/index.html) at the [Arizona Biltmore Hotel and Spa](http://www.arizonabiltmore.com/). We had a lot of fun, even if it was (relatively) cold out. Adam Felber, comedian and [blogger](http://felbers.net/mt/), won the quiz, bad jokes were made, and good times were had by all.
