As a graphic designer at heart, I have always held dear to me the tools I use to express myself visually. For many years now I have been a die-hard Macromedia disciple. Freehand (*Aldus* Freehand, mind you) was my first vector design tool, and I would take it over Illustrator any day. I still think it has the simpler paradigms and is easier to use. Dreamweaver has been my GUI html-editor of choice for ages, and Fireworks was hands-down the coolest thing I had ever seen. I *lived* in Fireworks for a couple years.
