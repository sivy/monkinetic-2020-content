I've been futzing with tags lately on this site. I've wanted to add tagging to my posts for some time (managing categories was too hard), and got around to installing the [Ultimate Tag Warrior](http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/) plugin for Wordpress. It's impressive in it's scope of features and complete ease of use. I've spent some time tagging the last year's worth of content (not as much as you might think) and it's a quick and easy process.
