One of my co-workers is somewhat of a lyricist/songwriter/singer. I've been listening to his demos for a few days now, and I'm pretty impressed. The [demos](http://www.coloured.net/music/index.html") are rough, to be sure (and "Johnny's voice is an acquired taste"), but his stuff gets in your head and doesn't leave. Esp. check out [3 Days](http://www.coloured.net/music/clips/10years3days.mp3), [Bookworm](http://www.coloured.net/music/clips/bookworm.mp3), and [South Mountain](http://www.coloured.net/music/clips/southmountain.mp3).
