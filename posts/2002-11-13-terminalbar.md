I've just set out a beta for a new app to a few users. The app is called "TerminalBar", and it lets you enter a unix command string (any number of commands tacked together with semi-colons), an optional working directory to run them in, and whether or not to open a new Terminal window to run it in (otherwise it gets run in the background).
