From [Wired](http://www.wired.com/): A high-schooler has [created a glove](http://www.wired.com/news/gizmos/0,1452,49716,00.html) that translates sign-language finger-spelling into text on a digital device via a wireless connection. That is awesome, and a real example of technology bettering the lives of the handicapped.
