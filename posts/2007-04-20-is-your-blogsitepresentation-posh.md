<abbr title="Plain Old Semantic HTML">[POSH](http://microformats.org/wiki/posh "Plain Old Semantic HTML")</abbr> is a new acronym/idea sprung from the foreheads of the idle chatterers ([just](http://tantek.com) [kidding](http://adactio.com), [guys](http://factoryjoe.com/blog)!) The idea is to give the idea of semantic (suitably meaningful in the linguistic sense) HTML an easy-to-remember handle.
