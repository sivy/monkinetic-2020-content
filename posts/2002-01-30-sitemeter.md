I always wondered what the rainbow-colored boxes were on sites i visited... [now I know](http://sm6.sitemeter.com/default.asp). And I have one too, now. SiteMeter gives good stats, without having to own a log analyzer yourself. Guess I can leave Macrobyte alone now and let them finish the [hassle hassle hassle].
