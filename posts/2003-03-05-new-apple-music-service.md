non-mp3-label-approved

It looks like Apple [may be announcing](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=77&amp;ncid=738&amp;e=11&amp;u=/mc/20030304/tc_mc/apple_music_service_forthcoming_) shortly a new music service for Mac/iPod owners, using label-approved music and non-mp3 format. Argh.

Apple had so much going for it - the whole digital hub thing, iTunes, iPod. Do they know it was MP3 support that made iTunes so frikkin popular? I wonder if they will continue to support MP3? I guess we'll see what happens.
