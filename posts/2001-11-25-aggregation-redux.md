I'm finally taking a day to hack on a project I've been wanting to do for ages. Others [have built](http://my.userland.com) [RSS news aggregators](http://www.google.com/search?q=RSS+news+aggregator) before, and I don't suppose mine will be anything special, but I'm digging deeper into WebObjects, and hope to implement some cool ideas in my own news aggregator.
