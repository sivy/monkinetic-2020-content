title: 3 Sites you could be reading since I haven't been posting
---
About 3 months ago I was transferred to a new group at work, to help them finish up a release, then to start in on some new features. Well, we are about one week from release, and we're in crunch mode. Because of the increased focus, and stress, posting here has almost dried up! Sorry about that.
