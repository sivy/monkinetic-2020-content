title: The Origin of the Palestine-Israel Conflict
---
[This page](http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/1298/9812123.html) from the Washingon Report has a very enlightening review of a book published in 1998: The Origin of the Palestine-Israel Conflict. It touches a bit on salient facts about the establishment of the nation of Israel by the British, and the removal of the indiginous Palestinians. Hard stuff, and the current conflict comes as no surprise.
