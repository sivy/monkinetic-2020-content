title: Trying to understand
---
I took a few minutes to google '[deaf blogs](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=deaf+blogs&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8)' today, trying to find somewhere to help me understand a bit of what my amazing, beautiful, hard-of-hearing soon-to-be-daughter may go through growing up. (If that was a bit hard to follow, sorry - it's the head space I'm in right now.)
