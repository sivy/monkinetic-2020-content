Wow, thanks to Idan Gazit for [recommending](http://monkinetic.blog/2020/04/30/#txt-ce6ce6a) Robert Jackson Bennett's #scifi #fantasy novel _Foundryside_.

Every think programming is magic? _IT IS_. Ever wonder complain that your code is doing what you said instead of what you meant? _BEWARE_. Magic and technology, mystical hacking, sentient objects and the ancient and tormented souls that drive them...

You're going to love it. Thanks Idan.
