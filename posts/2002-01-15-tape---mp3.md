mp3

I'm looking for solution to a particular problem. I have source audio material on cassette tape. Assuming I have a machine with audio inputs, what sort of software (preferably free, or cheap) should I be looking for to:
<li>rip the audio in realtime from the sound card to disk, <li>cut the file (it's lecture-style) into manageable portions, and
<li>convert the files  from (I assume) AIFF to MP3.<p>

Solutions can be Mac or PC, as I don't yet know where I'm going to be doing this. If you have ideas or pointers, please <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/859/reply
">post them</a>, and if there are any particularly good ones I'll point to them here.</p></li></li></li>
