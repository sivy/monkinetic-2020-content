title: More on Linksys/FTP problem

It would seem I'm not mistaken in [my reports](http://redmonk.net/archives/2002/10/16/active-ftp-linksys-wireless-bad/) of problems with active FTP and my Linksys [BEFW11S4](http://linksys.com/Products/product.asp?grid=23&amp;prid=173) router. >  Several people report the latest BEFW11S4 firmware is broken for Active mode. Here's a recent post: [/forum/remark,411550](http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum/remark,4115504~root=equip,16~mode=flat)..
